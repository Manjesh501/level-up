                                     PREFACE                                      
                                                                                  
               The Ramanujan College, formerly known as Deshbandhu College (Evening) was
               established in 1958 by the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government of India, in the
               memory of Late Lala Deshbandhu Gupta, a patriot who had dedicated his life to
               the national freedom struggle. The Deshbandhu College (Evening) operated
               from the premises of the Deshbandhu College that functioned in the morning
               hours. Originally run by the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Education as a men's
                                                                                  
               College, Deshbandhu College (Evening) became a co-educational institution in
               1994. This College, which is 100% funded by the University Grants Commission
               (UGC) has been maintained by the University of Delhi since 1972.   
                                                                                  
               Till the early 90's the College catered to a large number of students who were
               gainfully employed in the daytime and pursued their studies in the convenience
               provided by an evening College. During its initial years the College used to
               function in the late evening hours and developed as a reputed College especially
               in the field of Commerce studies. Other than B. Com (Honours) and B.Com, the
               College offered B.A. Programme and Honours courses in English, Hindi and
               Political Science to its students. The College was also unique because it offered
               the study of regional languages: Punjabi, Bengali and Sindhi. Late Dr. M.L.
               Jotwani, an eminent scholar of Sindhi literature and language was a member of
               the College teaching faculty and did the College proud when he received the
               Padma Shri in 2003.                                                
                                                                                  
               In spite of being an evening College that was sharing space and infrastructure
               with another College, Deshbandhu College (Evening) regularly produced good
               results in academics and sports. Champion athletes, especially in the fields of
               power lifting and weight lifting, won University, state and national level acclaim.
                                                                                  
               In the year 2010, the College got a new identity when the University of Delhi
               along with UGC and the MHRD renamed Deshbandhu College (Evening) as
               Ramanujan College, and allocated separate space of seven acres of land within
               the existing College campus in Kalkaji, New Delhi. From an evening College it
                                                                                  
               become a full-fledged morning College in 2012. The College was given a go
               ahead to design and construct an independent building and create infrastructure
               of its own.                                                        
                                                                                  
               We are proud that our College is named after Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan
               (1887-1920) the legendary Indian mathematician, who during his short lifetime
               compiled nearly 3900 mathematical results that made him one of the world's
               greatest-ever mathematical genius.                                 
                                                                                  
               Though the plans are ready and all permissions and sanctions have been acquired
               for the construction of a new building in the land allocated to our College, the
               College is yet to get funds to construct its own building. Nevertheless, in the past
               four years, we have been able to immensely develop the space and resources
               available to us. We have constructed twenty six spacious, well ventilated, ICT
               enabled portable cabins and created additional space, infrastructure and
               facilities for more class rooms, auditorium and laboratories. We are in the
               process of constructing ten additional portable cabins. Additional staff rooms,
               extra washrooms, rooms for different centres of academic excellence and a

               renovated library with air conditioned reading rooms have been constructed for
               students and teachers.                                             
                                                                                  
               We have added generators for uninterrupted power supply and augmented our
               water supply system and provided continuous RO filtered drinking water for our
               students, teachers and the non-teaching staff. Many air-conditioned spaces have
               been created in the office, staffroom, library, auditorium and activity halls for the
               comfort of all. We have kept the needs of the physically disabled as a priority in
                                                                                  
               our developmental schemes. Our dependence on shared infrastructure has
               reduced considerably through our own efforts.                      
               Today, the Ramanujan College offers Honours degree courses in Commerce,
                                                                                  
               Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, Psychology, English,
               Hindi and Political Science. It continues to offer B.A. Programme and B.Com
               courses as before. It is the third largest College for Commerce education in the
               University of Delhi. The College looks forward to a large expansion which is in
               tune with contemporary academic and professional requirements of our country.
               In the near future we seek to introduce Honours courses in Journalism in English,
               History, Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) and Philosophy. We have also
               applied to the UGC for eight proposed programmes under the Deen Dayal
               Upadhyay Centres for Knowledge Acuisition and Upgradation of Skilled
               Human Abilities and Livelihood (KAUSHAL) scheme. The College has a 
               highly qualified and experienced faculty some of whom are also engaged in post
               graduate teaching at the University. A large number of our teachers have original
               published academic and creative work in reputed national and international
                                                                                  
               journals. Departments of the College regularly organise seminars, workshops
               and special lectures to benefit both students and teachers. We endeavour to make
               our College a centre for excellence in interdisciplinary studies and research.
                                                                                  
               The College has a well stocked, information technology enabled and 
               computerized library, with about 30,000 books including the latest publication
               and journals in all the subjects taught in the College. This, together with state-of-
               the-art computer labs, offers students access to new horizons of learning.
                                                                                  
               A number of academic prizes and scholarships are being offered to meritorious
               students. Financial assistance in the form of fee-concession is given to deserving
               and needy students. Our large playground and good facilities for sports have
               helped us to maintain a tradition of excellence in sports. Our sportspersons
               continue to win various prizes at the University, Delhi State and national levels.
                                                                                  
               One of the new innovative initiatives has been the setting up of the Centre for
               Ethics and Values in 2010. Keeping in mind the pressing need to mould a socially
               concerned and conscientious student with moral and ethical uprightness, this
               centre blends its activities with the regular academic and cultural programmes of
               the College. Other than organising lectures, debates and discussions, the Centre
               encourages introspection and positive thinking and has creatively involved the
               students through internship, summer training, poster making, theatre, art and
               music, in ideas related to ethics and morality. The Centre has organised two
               international and one national level seminars and has published three volumes of

               The College campus is a lively hub of both academic and co-curricular activities
               which are meant to nurture the all-round development of the students. The
               annual cultural festival of the College JOSH, which attracts students from
               Colleges across the city, is a popular event where students showcase their talents
                                                                                  
               in music, dance, theatre, oration and art and craft. The College has a theatre
               group Jazba that has been winning acclaim for their socially relevant theatre
               presentation. Their evocative street play called Bhook dealing with the issues of
               hunger in our country won the 'Sahitya Kala Parishad Award' for the best street
               play in their inter-college competition in 2015. They have also produced plays
               dealing with consumer awareness for the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. The
               film appreciation club of the College First Cut cultivates the talents of future film
               makers and has produced a number of well made short films. We believe the
               students of the College are its real assets, giving it strength and character.
                                                                                  
               The Ramanujan College won the 'Good Practices Award' in 2014 at the annual
               festival of the University of Delhi – Antardhvani. The College is aspiring for a
               future of growth and development. It seeks to make its place as a foremost
               academic institution in the country.                               
                                                                                  
               This Self Study Report follows the guidelines of the National Assessment and
               Accreditation Council's (NAAC) Manual for Self Study Report for Constituent
               Colleges. The entire teaching faculty and the non-teaching staff of the College
               have worked very hard in the preparation of this report. We have made an
               introspective and honest self study of our college and recorded it in the various
               sections and units of this report. I am privileged to submit this report to the

               The Ramanujan College, which began as Deshbandhu College (Evening) in
               1958, remained for more than five decades a college that functioned only in the
               latter half of the day. In spite of the fact that the College had a reputation of being a
               good educational institute that catered to the academic needs of the students who
               were employed during the day time, the College was never taken as seriously as a
               full-time morning college generally is. It was only in 2010, when Deshbandhu
                                                                                  
               College (Evening) was renamed as Ramanujan College and was elevated to the
               status of a full-time morning college with the promise of a building of its own that
               a surge of enthusiasm and renewed commitment galvanized the College towards
               greater heights.                                                   
                                                                                  
               The approach to develop the College was two pronged. Firstly, the College
               sought to provide itself with good infrastructural facilities in terms of more
               classrooms, a multipurpose auditorium, seminar and conference halls and an
               uninterrupted and adequate electricity and water supply. The overall ambiance of
               the college was to be enhanced with an aesthetically pleasing environment
               constituting lawns, gardens and pathways. The second initiative was to expand
               the academic spectrum of the College through the introduction of new courses,
               centers of excellence and providing the students with the opportunity of various
               extracurricular activities.                                        
                                                                                  
               In the past five years, much of the developmental objectives of the College have
               been achieved despite the fact that we have not received funds to proceed with the
               construction of the new College building, though plans and permission have been
               sanctioned and obtained for it.                                    
                                                                                  
               The College offers courses in Commerce, Humanities and Science. The College
               has a faculty of 97 teachers (permanent, ad-hoc and part time), 53 non-teaching
               staff and 2 technical staff, and about 2,000 students.             
                                                                                  
               Presented below are the brief summaries of the seven criteria of evaluation used
               in the Self Study Report:                                          
                                                                                  
               Criterion I: Curricular Aspects                                    
                                                                                  
               Inspired by the name of the great mathematician, Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan,
               our College adheres to the core values of dedication, hard work and commitment
               as encapsulated in the motto of the University of Delhi. The syllabus and
               curriculum followed by the College is set by the University of Delhi. Some of
               the members of our Faculty are also members of curriculum framing  
               committees of the University Departments. The College caters to almost 50%
               of the students belonging to the economically weaker sections of the society. It is
               a challenge to achieve the curriculum objectives, but the teachers of the College
                                                                                  
               have evolved innovative and effective ways of delivering curriculum content that
               is specifically moulded for the students of our College. The College has
               provided laptops to all its teachers and all the classrooms are ICT enabled
               and the entire campus is Wi-Fi enabled. This has greatly felicitated the
               implementation of the curriculum as important online data bases of research

               classroom as an aid to teaching. The faculty regularly sends feedback to the
               University Departments regarding the curriculum with suggestions for
               restructuring and improvement. With the dynamics of the employment 
               market in mind and with the intention of providing skill development courses, the
                                                                                  
               College has introduced three certificate courses: Certificate Course in Human
               Rights, Personality and English Enhancement Course and Certificate Course in
               French Language. There are plans to introduce four more Honours courses. Now,
               the emphasis is on interdisciplinary and experiential pedagogy that
               integrates issues of gender, language, environment, human rights and
               information technology. The College organises regular seminars, special
               lectures, educational excursions and trips along with faculty development
               programmes and training modules for the effective implementation of the
               curriculum. To evaluate the curriculum delivery and its effectiveness, the
               College Internal Quality Assessment Cell (IQAC) has initiated feedback
               systems for both students and the faculty. The College is also planning to
               introduce an online feedback system for the students from the next academic
               year.

               The Ramanujan College considers its smooth and efficient admission process as
               one of its best practices. This ensures that the students who are admitted to the
               College establish a warm bonding with the Institution. This bonding is reflected
               in the cordial relations between the teacher and the student, which goes a long
               way to ensure a healthy teaching-learning process. In accordance to the rules of
                                                                                  
               the University of Delhi regarding admissions, the College have seen a steady rise
               in its cut-off percentages in the past five years, which means academically better
               students are seeking admissions to the College every year. The College
               encourages the women students by giving concessions on cut-off percentage
               as a part of its admission policy. A large number of students from the
               economically weaker section of the society are admitted to the College along
               with students from the North Eastern states of the country. The College also
               admits differently-abled students and provides them with all the support. The
               College helps students with fee concessions, scholarships from the Student's Aid
               Fund and remedial classes are organised to bridge the knowledge gaps and
               support the marginalised students. The faculty has evolved innovative
               approaches for teaching which includes field visits, film screening,
               presentations and project work. The computerised library with about 30,000
                                                                                  
               books is a support to the teaching-learning process with about 500 users
               accessing it every day. The time-table is prepared well in advance in the
               beginning of an academic session so that the teaching can begin from the very
               first day of the session. The syllabus is available on the College website. The
               College has a system of feedback and regular assessment meetings in each
               Department to ensure effective delivery of the syllabus and evaluate the learning
               levels. The College recruits the best of the academic minds and encourages the
               teachers to pursue higher academics, research and knowledge upgradation. The
               College IAQC monitors the data regarding the performances of the students in
               the exams and internal assessments and suggests ways of improvement in the
               teaching-learning process. Policies regarding effective implementation of
               time-tables, extra classes, internal assessment are set by the IAQC in

               consultation with the Departments. For the past few years the College, for
               reasons beyond its control, has not been able to recruit permanent faculty and has
               appointed ad-hoc and guest faculty. This has certainly affected the teaching-
               learning process and we hope that with more appointments of permanent faculty,
                                                                                  
               the teaching-learning process will be further strengthened.

               As an undergraduate constituent College of the University of Delhi, research
               possibilities in the College are limited. Nevertheless, the College promotes and
               encourages research by its faculty and tries to inculcate research-oriented
               academics for its students. Various FDPs, workshops and seminars are
                                                                                  
               organized by the College to encourage faculty research. Regular paper
               presentations and original project work by the students is an integral part of the
               pedagogic process in the College. The College has been sanctioned three
               Innovation Projects, which have research components in it, by the  
               University of Delhi. With the introduction of the Robotics and Artificial
               Intelligence Laboratory and the Ramanujan Centre for Applied       
               Mathematics and Research, the College is now moving into areas of  
               advanced research. Individually, the teachers of the College have done
               independent research in their fields and have been regularly presenting and
               publishing their research works in books and both national and international
               journals. The present faculty has 160 research publications and 66 books to
               its credit. The faculty is also engaged in providing their scholarship as resource
               to other academic institutions. To keep abreast with the latest in the field, the
                                                                                  
               College has been inviting imminent speakers and experts from across the country
               for special lectures in the College. In the past two years more than 40 such
               scholars have visited the College. As a part of inter-disciplinary approaches to
               research, the College has been having inter-departmental workshops and
               Faculty Development Programmes. The Centre for Ethics and Values plays
               a crucial role in promoting extension activities of the College by engaging the
               faculty and the students in innovative manners. It is done by liasoning the
               Institution with the immediate neighbourhood and the society at large. The
               Centre for Ethics and Values has published three volumes of the International
               Journal of Applied Ethics. Five members of the faculty have also received awards
               and recognition for their research work.

               In the last four years, the College has spent more that Rs. 5 crore on
               augmenting its infrastructure and learning resources. The College has
               invested considerably in constructing 26 porta-cabins for holding classes and
               other activities. We intend to construct another 10 porta-cabins and one more
               computer lab for the next academic year. Arrangements for adequate water
               supply and electricity has also been made. We have spent almost Rs. 18 lacs in
               the financial year 2014-15 on just the purchase and maintenance of 
                                                                                  
               computers. We have 120 computers in our labs and we have distributed 800
               computers (laptops) to the students that were given to the College by the
               University of Delhi. As a resource, we have added the Ramanujan Centre for
               Applied Mathematics and Research, the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence

               Rights. We have plans ready for the introduction of a Media Lab in the next
               academic year. As a part of developing sports facilities we have created a 400
               meter long athletic track and a cricket pitch. We also have a gymnasium and a

               most innovative ideas as best practices. In the absence of a building due to non
               availability of funds, the College has built a campus of its own by
               constructing 26 porta-cabins and creating a pleasing environment with
               pathways, gardens and lawns. This way, the College circumvented the problem
                                                                                  
               of classroom space and was able to expand by introducing new courses and
               creating space for labs, activity rooms and centres for promoting excellence.
               The College is proud to present the activities of the Centre for Ethics and
                                                                                  
               Values as one of the best practices. It is indeed a unique venture. The Centre is
               has successfully integrated ethical and moral values in the students through inter-
               disciplinary creative and imaginative activities that involve the entire college
               community.                                                         
                                                                                  
               The College regards its reformed, extremely efficient and student-friendly
               admission process as another of its best practices. The College believes that the
               students seeking admission must be given the highest priority and made to feel
               comfortable and welcome. The College has evolved a very simple but efficient
               admission process with the help of technology and the support of its staff.
                                                                                  
               The College constantly endeavours to make its campus eco-friendly. Waste
               management, rain water harvesting, tree plantation and regular cleanliness
               drives are central to the Institution's constant effort towards keeping the
               College campus clean and healthy.

               1. We have a very supportive, encouraging, motivating and cooperative Top
                  Management and Administration.                                  
                                                                                  
               2. The College has a highly qualified, dedicated and hard-working teaching
                  faculty, many of whom are also technically competent.           
                                                                                  
               3. It is our strength that we function with enthusiasm and gusto from the
                  temporary but spaciously built and information technology-enabled porta
                  cabins for classes and other activities in absence of the new building for
                  which funds are awaited.                                        
                                                                                  
               4. We have highly motivated staff who are always eager to experiment and
                  innovate, resulting in high academic performance.               
                                                                                  
               5. We face challenges with fortitude.

               1. The College needs to have a greater interaction with industry to ensure that
                                                                                  
                  the aspirations of the students find fulfilment. This is required to convert the
                  knowledge gathered in the College through curriculum into practical skills
                  that can accomplish the developmental needs of the country.     
                                                                                  
               2. The College also feels the need to establish greater contact with
                  agencies/institutions outside the College and its parent University for
                  research purposes. This is also necessary to expand the research interest of
                  the faculty and to provide them adequate resource support.      
                                                                                  
               3. For the past many years, the process of appointment of teachers has not been a
                  regular and smooth process in the University of Delhi. This has skewed the
                  ratio of permanent faculty in relation to the ad-hoc, temporary and guest
                  faculty. There is an urgent need to increase the percentage of permanent
                  faculty for a balanced overall growth of the Institution.       
                                                                                  
               OPPORTUNITIES                                                      
                                                                                  
               1. The expansion of the College that is on the cards in the near future is the
                  biggest opportunity for not only a modern-state-of-the-art infrastructural
                  facility but also for the introduction of new courses that are the need of the
                  hour.                                                           
                                                                                  
               2. It is an opportunity to put our minds and abilities together to bridge the
                  existing knowledge gaps between different sections of our society.
                                                                                  
               3. In a globalizing world, it is an opportunity to empower our students with the
                  ability to transform their knowledge into skills and transact these skills to
                  become responsible citizens of the world.

                  helplessness and inspire them into creative, innovative and imaginative
                  thinking.                                                       
                                                                                  
               3. It is a challenge to make the youth of today ethically and morally strong with

               25. Dropout rate in Under Graduate degree programs                 
                                                                                  
                  Under the University of Delhi examination system a student is given multiple
                  chances to clear his exam and get a degree even after the expiry of the term of
                  the course. In such a situation many students of the College appear for exams
                  after a gap and qualify the course. Therefore, to accurately state the
                  percentage of dropout rate is almost impossible. Nevertheless, in our
                  experience we could say that less than 10 % of the enrolled students drop out
                  and do not complete the course.

               The faculty of Ramanujan College is a balance between experience and youth.
               Many senior faculty members have been actively associated in curriculum
               development at the University level. The B.A. Program Application Course on
               Film studies was introduced in our College as a first in the University in 2006.
               The faculty teaching this course has helped the University develop e- lessons on
               this course and has been monitoring this course at the level of evaluation too.

               The Ramanujan College offers Certificate Courses on 'Human Rights' and
               'Personality and English Enhancement Course'. The College also offers a
                                                                                  
               Certificate Course in French language.                             
               The Course on Human Rights is being conducted by the Department of Political
               Science of the College. The Course is in response to a growing demand among
                                                                                  
               students for informed awareness about human rights which is perceived as an
               important issue today. For the creation of global citizens it is necessary for a
               learning based on judicial systems and its laws on human rights, consumer laws,
               human values of ethics and morality.                               
                                                                                  
               Many students who get enrolled in our College are first generation learners, or
               have graduated from schools where the medium of instruction is Hindi. Such
               students feel the need to enhance their English language skills to face the
               challenges of contemporary multilingual world. The Certificate Course in
               Personality and English Enhancement seeks to address these concerns of the
               students. It focuses on the usage of English in professional and general contexts.

               every resource and facility to ensure that curriculum implementation is smooth
               and unhindered. The primary objective of the curriculum set by the University

               help the student to mature into a capable human resource who is able to find
               opportunities and also effectively deliver the need to develop the various sectors

               updated with latest books and that help in curriculum delivery. Often, hands-on
               approaches along with experiential learning techniques are used for the effective
               implementation of the curriculum.

               University-prescribed curriculum to offer students these supplementary courses
               and the UGC supported remedial classes for enhancing career opportunities. The
               Ethics Centre established by the College also contributes towards the curriculum

               follows the prescribed curriculum for the degree pursued and as such offers no
               twining or dual degree. However, it must be mentioned that many students of
               B.Com and B. Com (Hons.) pursue the career option of Chartered Accountancy
               and Company Secretaryship. These students are guided by the experienced
               faculty of the College.

               The endeavor at the Ramanujan College has been to encourage a wholesome
               education that equips the student not only with knowledge and skills but also
               enriches the personality through social awareness and a moral conscience.
                                                                                  
               The introduction of the concept of Integrated Mind Body Heart as a pedagogic
               input by the University of Delhi in 2013 inspired the College to undertake an
               innovative exercise in the form on a four day long inter-disciplinary Program
               called Antargyan. The Program was organized and conceptualized by the Centre
               for Ethics and Values, in collaboration with Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti,
               Baha'i House of Worship and Jamia Hamdard. The Program involved students in

               years:                                                             
                                                                                  
                  1. B. Tech in Computer Science                                  
                  2. Honours in Economics                                         
                  3. Honours in Mathematics                                       
                  4. Honours in Psychology

               These Courses were introduced under the Four Year Undergraduate Program
               (FYUP). After the discontinuation of the FYUP these Courses have been
               converted into special three year courses except for the B. Tech Computer
               Science Course for which the College has applied for AICTE approval. The
               College plans to offer the other courses as regular courses in the three year
                                                                                  
               undergraduate mode from the admission year 2015-16.                
               The College offers the following skill development Programs:       
                                                                                  
               Certificate Course on Human Rights.                                
               Certificate Course on Personality and English Enhancement Course.

               The rationale behind the introduction of these new courses is twofold. Firstly,
               since the College is now a full-fledged morning College looking forward to a
               new building and added infrastructure, its scope of expansion is greatly
                                                                                  
               enhanced and thus, introducing new courses is imperative for the health and
               growth of the institution. Secondly, the College has chosen these Courses as it
               seeks to become an important hub and resource center of inter-disciplinary study
               of Humanities and Commerce courses along with the study of Mathematics. In
               the year 2015, the College also applied to the University for the approval of the
               following courses:

               year to year. Broadly, the University recognizes the elective and the vocational
               subjects that are offered by various boards across the country. In the language
               subjects; elective, core and functional are generally accepted by the University.
                                                                                  
               The average percentage of the best of four subjects of the final school exam,
               including one language, is considered for admissions. The cut-off percentage is
               decided by the College and announced through the College's and the 
               University's websites, newspapers and notice boards.               
                                                                                  
               Any other special requirements are also displayed on the notice board and
               website. If seats remain vacant, the cut-off percentage is lowered in subsequent
               round of admissions. The University allows as many as seven rounds of
               admission process to exhaust all available seats. If seats still remain vacant, then
               the College advertises seeking fresh admission applications.       
                                                                                  
               The process of admission in our College is specifically described in details in the
               section on Best Practices. The parents or guardians, accompanying the students,
               acknowledge and appreciate this. We believe that the manner in which we
               organize our Admission process is extremely systematic, efficient and student-
               friendly. We consider it as one of our Best Practices.

               2.1.4 Reviewing the admission process and student profiles annually.
                                                                                  
               The Admission Committee reviews the admission process and the students'
               profiles (determined mainly through cut-off percentages) and reports to the Staff
               Council. The Admission Committee also looks into the grievances, and is
               responsible for their mitigation. The Admission Committee ensures fair and
               smooth admission for all applicants, including categories like differently-abled,
               staff quota, extracurricular activities (ECA), sports and foreign nationals. It is
               for the Admission Committee to correctly interpret and implement the
               guidelines of the admission policy of the University of Delhi.     
                                                                                  
               2.1.5 Strategies adopted by the institution to demonstrate/reflect the National
                    commitment to diversity and inclusion.                        
                                                                                  
               The location of the Ramanujan College is at the intersection of high profile upper-
               middle class colonies of South Delhi and the upcoming suburban rural and urban
               colonies located in the South and South East part of the city bordering the state of
               Haryana. This provides the College with a catchment area that is economically
               and socially diverse with a substantial population of minorities.  
                                                                                  
               The College has as a policy of giving benefit of percentage marks at the point of
               admission to women students. Since 1994, when the College became a co-
               educational college, the College aligned itself with the national goal of educating
               and empowering women in our society. With a very strict and vigilant anti-sexual
               harassment and anti-ragging committee, the College reaches out to its women
               students, especially the ones from economically weaker sections with moral
               support. The change of the College timing from late evening/afternoon to
                                                                                  
               morning has also helped the woman students, specially the one who commute
               from far distances.

               The OBC, SC, ST students are given preference as per the University of Delhi
               guidelines and directives. Extra effort is put so as to fill up the seats of these
               categories. Foreign nationals and students from Jammu and Kashmir and also
               armed forces are given preference.                                 
                                                                                  
               For the past five years we have seen a substantial number of students from the
               states of the North East. A teacher has been given the responsibility to address any
               problems faced by the students from the North Eastern states of the country. The
                                                                                  
               College plans to provide an exclusive hostel to the students from the North East as
               and when it is able to construct its own building.                 
               The Cultural Committee, the NSS and the Student's Union is especially cautious
                                                                                  
               and ensures that no discrimination takes place in selection of students for various
               cultural and other extracurricular activities on the basis of gender, caste, region,
               race and religion.                                                 
                                                                                  
               The College has provided infrastructural facilities for the differently-abled
               students by constructing ramps, specially designed toilets. Reading material in
               the Braille is available in the Library. Regular remedial classes for academically
               weak students are organized. Financial assistance in the form of fee concession is
               given to the economically weaker sections.

               tribe students. The academic interventions in forms of seminars, discussions and
               lectures organized by the Centre for Ethics and Values also helps in maintaining a

               in the faculty who do research and write on Dalit Literature and Sociology and
               actively participate in raising the conscious level of students regarding
               discriminations in our society and its ways of prevention.

               The College is proud to acknowledge that there are a large number of bright and
               academically proficient students in the College. In the classroom the teachers are
               able to identify such students and assess their aptitude and encourage them
               through special academic projects and other co-curricular activities to optimize
               their potential. The Department of English has initiated a program of writing
               research papers which are evaluated and awarded. Identified advanced learners
               have been selected for innovation projects of the University of Delhi. One of our
               students has been awarded half major scholarship by the International

               The Institution collects information from teachers and analyses results and
               identifies weaker students. The Institution initiates special classes, provides
               books and other study material for such students. There is a Fee Concession and
               Students' Aid Fund for the economically deprived students.         
                                                                                  
               The teachers of the College Council advise economically weaker students as to
               how they could address their economic or personal problems. There are very few
               students who dropout of the College due to financial inability. Nevertheless, the
               College authorities are always willing to solve such problems.

               2.3.10 Challenges in completing the curriculum within the planned time frame
                    and calendar                                                  
                                                                                  
               The College seriously endeavors to complete curriculum within time frame and
               calendar. Since the implementation of the Semester system in the University of
               Delhi, and the introduction of bi-annual examinations the time frame to complete
               course is considerably tightened and thus completing course is a challenge.
                                                                                  
               The challenge is taken up earnestly by the College by adopting the following
               measures:                                                          
                                                                                  
                 1. The Master Time-Table is prepared well before the commencement of the
                    academic session and the Departments prepare individual and class time-
                    tables which are uploaded on the College website before beginning of the
                    semester. Time-tables are sent to the faculty through e-mail. This ensures
                    that classes commence on the very first day of the semester.  
                                                                                  
                 2. Students from second semester on wards are informed that course work
                    begins on the first day irrespective of announcement of results of the
                    previous semester exam.                                       
                 3. The Departments hold monthly assessment meetings to take cognizance
                    of course work completed and report it to the College administration. The
                                                                                  
                    Departments also ensure that reading material and texts for various
                    courses are all available in the Library for the students. Study material
                    available on internet is downloaded and made available for the students.
                 4. In case there is any long leave taken by any teacher, the administration
                    promptly appoints guest faculty so that classes are not wasted for lack of
                    teacher.                                                      
                                                                                  
                 5. The faculty takes extra classes to complete syllabus and the  
                    administration arranges classrooms and other infrastructural support for
                    extra classes. Sometimes extra classes are taken on Sundays and other
                    holidays.                                                     
                 6. For the syllabus to be completed in time it is important that slow learners
                    are given special attention. Remedial classes are organized for them.
                                                                                  
               2.3.11 Monitoring and evaluating the quality of teaching-learning. 
                                                                                  
               Under the guidance of the Internal Quality Assessment Cell (IQAC) of the
               College the monitoring and evaluation of the teaching learning process is done in
               the following manner:                                              
                                                                                  
                 1. There is a feedback system for both teachers and students. The feedback
                    is analyzed and necessary corrective measures are taken to improve the
                    teaching learning process.                                    
                                                                                  
                 2. Regular test, assignments, paper presentations and viva-voce by students
                    also help in monitoring the quality of teaching and learning. 
                 3. The IQAC also monitors the internal assessment marks of students.
                 4. The Principal holds meetings with class representatives and gets
                    feedback regarding the teaching learning process.

               The College mainly follows the policies and systems of the University of Delhi to
               recharge teachers but also takes its own initiatives. Research grants have
               provided by the University of Delhi through the Innovation Projects. The UGC
               also provides funds for travelling abroad to the scholars attending seminars and
               conferences. Three faculty members have availed this facility in the past three
               years. The College sanctions study leave to the teachers to pursue their research
               work. The College Administration also gives lien to teachers who seek to engage
                                                                                  
               themselves in teaching outside the University of Delhi system. The policy is one
               of total support and facilitation to faculty engaged in recharging themselves
               academically.                                                      
                                                                                  
               2.4.5-6 Faculty awards and recognition and evaluation of teachers by the
               students and external Peers.                                       
               At present there is no one in the Faculty who has received an award or recognition
                                                                                  
               for teaching. Nevertheless, there are many teachers in the College who are well
               known for their scholarship and delivery of lecturers. These teachers are regularly
               called by other institution both within the University and outside to deliver
               lectures or act as resource persons in seminars and workshops.     
                                                                                  
               The College has introduced a feedback system which has helped in assessment of
               the strengths of each teacher. For promotions teachers are evaluated by the Peer
               groups appointed by the University of Delhi for assessment, evaluation and
               interview.                                                         
                                                                                  
               2.5  Evaluation Process and Reforms                                
               2.5.1- 5 Information regarding Evaluation Process and Reforms      
                                                                                  
               The evaluation process set by the University of Delhi is prominently featured in
               the University website (du.ac.in) for each of its papers in different courses and
               programs. The College also informs the students and the faculty through its
               Handbook and website and through notices on notice boards.         
                                                                                  
               Teachers inform the students about the evaluation system. Since most of the teachers
               of the College are engaged in the examination and evaluation process of the
               University of Delhi, all crucial information regarding the evaluation process is
               intimated to the students. Every Department decides on a uniform mode of evaluation.

               The two central features of the evaluation system of the University of Delhi are
               the Internal Assessment (IA) and the centralized evaluation of answer scripts. The
               Moderation Committee of the College scrutinizes and removes discrepancies if
               any, in the Internal Assessment submitted by various Departments before they are
                                                                                  
               finally sent to the University.                                    
               The internal assessment marks of students are put up on the website of the
               College. Since attendance is also a part of Internal Assessment, the attendance of
                                                                                  
               each student is also put up on the website. Internal Assessment marks are
               submitted by individual teachers only after students have verified and signed.
               This process makes the system error free and transparent.          
                                                                                  
               2.5.6 Graduate attributes College focuses on.                      
               The Ramanujan College strives to inculcate in its students the vision, mission and
               objectives as the chief attributes of the graduates of the College. The graduates of
                                                                                  
               the College are not only academically accomplished but are also endowed with
               skills and have a holistic all round development. They are conscientious human
               beings with compassion and a commitment towards nation building. The
               graduate attributes of the students are defined by the Principal in his address to the
               students at the formal Orientation ceremony at the start of the academic year. The
               Principal reiterates the values and attributes of the Ramanujan College graduate
               during the formal farewell ceremonies also.                        
                                                                                  
               2.5.7 Mechanisms for redressal of grievances with reference to evaluation.
                                                                                  
               The College Grievance Committee is empowered to take decisions regarding
               complaints about evaluation. The students are free to consult teachers to voice
               their grievances regarding evaluation.                             
                                                                                  
               Before submission the final Internal Assessment marks are reviewed by the
               Departments and then the College Moderation Committee. As said before the
               marks are sent to the University only after each student has signed his/her Internal
               Assessment records. If any inadvertent error happens, these are reported to the
               University by the College.

               The College website clearly states the vision, mission and objectives of the
               institution. The staff and students are made aware of the aims of the College
               through Orientation Programs, Seminars and Talks. The Institution makes all
               efforts to provide the students opportunities to deliberate on various alternatives
                                                                                  
               and make informed choices, so that they become independent, strong yet
               sensitive individuals with analytical abilities and innovative thinking. The focus
               is also on motivating the students to equip them with skills so that they are able to
               face the challenges of the modern world.

               2.6.3 Teaching, learning and assessment strategies of the Institution.
                                                                                  
               The College provides good infrastructural facilities to optimize the achievement
               of the intended learning outcomes. To promote academic growth the departments
               organize seminars, workshops, competitions. To facilitate a holistic development
               of the students the College provides them opportunities to develop their talents
                                                                                  
               through the different discipline associations and cultural societies and in this way
               the students are initiated into collaborative learning, teamwork and
               organizational skills. The departments organize field trips, tours, and educational
               excursions to give the students practical experience to establish a connection
               between the classroom understanding and real life situations. The report of the
               activities of each Department and Society is discussed and means of
               improvement are initiated.                                         
                                                                                  
               2.6.4 Measures/Initiatives taken up by the institution to enhance the social and
                    economic relevance.                                           
                                                                                  
               The College has societies like National Service Scheme, the Eco Club O-Zone,
               the Centre for Ethics and Values, and the Centre for Human Rights studies,
               Accounting and Finance Lab, career oriented add-on certificate courses and a
               Placement Cell which enhance the social and economic relevance of the courses
               that the College offers. This is also done through creative writing competitions,
               co-curricular activities such as talks and seminars organized by the Departments,
               out-reach programs organized by societies to create social awareness, inter-
               disciplinary, innovation research projects and internships.        
                                                                                  
               2.6.5 Collection and analysis of data on student performance and learning
                    outcomes and using it for planning and overcoming barriers of learning
                                                                                  
               Individual potential of students and their weaknesses are identified at the
               classroom level as well as through personal interactions by the faculty. The
               analysis of results of tests, tutorials, assignments and projects also helps in
               assessing the students' performance and progress. Analysis of these data helps in
               identifying individual student weakness and also the problem areas of the
               curriculum. Supplementary reading material and alternative teaching strategies
                                                                                  
               are applied to overcome these issues.                              
               2.6.6-7 Monitoring and ensuring the achievement of learning outcomes and use
                    of assessment / evaluation outcomes for future planning.      
                                                                                  
               The College IQAC monitors the data and the suggestions of the faculty to ensure
               the achievement of learning outcomes. Retests and extra assignments are often
               advised to improve learning outcomes of students. Remedial classes are also
               held. The College is aware of the fact that a class is not homogenous in ability
               level and therefore special attention needs to be given to some students to achieve
               uniform levels of performance.

               The final exam results of students are markers of the achievement of the student's
               learning objective. A good exam result ensures better prospects both for advance

               3.1.4 Efforts made by the Institution in developing scientific temper, research
                    culture and aptitude among students.                          
                                                                                  
               The Ramanujan College promotes Innovation Projects and tries to meet the
               demands of the global market through these projects. There have been several
               educational and professional interfaces with the industry, both in form of
               interactions and visits, keeping in mind the scope of the subjects and the interest
               of the students. Though field work and data collection are primary to these
               projects, we have also realized that these projects help us in the expansion of
                                                                                  
               knowledge-base and availing opportunities beyond the boundaries of the
               College. In this context, the experience of our students, as participants in the
               Gyanodaya Project of the University of Delhi, needs to be acknowledged. Our
               students have participated in all the six Gyanodaya Projects of the University.
               These educational tours in special trains aim at broadening the horizons of
               learning beyond the classrooms. In the last two excursions, project work was
               carried out by the students on 'Mizo youth perspective towards society and
               matrimony', 'Relevance of Article 371G' and on the 'Flora and Fauna of Northeast
               India'.                                                            
                                                                                  
               The Ramanujan Center for Applied Mathematics and Research in collaboration
               with the Departments of Statistics, Mathematics and Computer Science
               effectively promotes the internalization of research aptitude among its students
               with an aim of higher understanding, which gets reflected in their academic
               responses as well. The Department of Computer Science has developed software
               that is used for an effective planning of the College Master Time-Table. They
               have also developed software that helps physically challenged students. The
                                                                                  
               Centre for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence has been active in designing
               software for robotic science.                                      
                                                                                  
               SOFTWARE DESIGNED FOR YAMUNA  BIODIVERSITY PARK.                   
               This software applies Computer Science knowledge to Environmental  
               Science. This software will enable the visitors (students, research scholars,
               scientists, general public) of the Park to attain all the environmental education
               related to it. It will also provide a single platform to the users to get the
               information, instead of referring too many resources.              
                                                                                  
               SOFTWARE FOR MASTER TIME TABLE FOR RAMANUJAN COLLEGE               
               The software generates optimized time table for the college according to the
               workload of classes and rooms available. The software efficiently manages the
               allocation process to prevent the slot redundancy of a room, teacher and class.
                                                                                  
               The entire College is ICT-enabled with Wi-Fi facility. The students and the
               teachers have been equipped with personal laptops, which have helped the
                                                                                  
               pedagogy at classroom level to touch higher level of research-based teachings.
               With information and knowledge accessibility at one's finger tips, the classroom
               interaction breaks conventional boundaries and helps the students in seeking and
               expressing deeper research based understandings.

               The teachers transmit research analysis and research interests in the day to day
               classroom pedagogic practices. They make the students aware of the ongoing
                                                                                  
               research level activities in a particular field and discipline. The classroom
               interaction is enriched by such inputs and the students get first-hand information.
               The fact, that many B.Com (Hons.) students have involved themselves in the
               projects and assignments related to global finance is because of the research

               interests that many teachers of the Department of Commerce have in the area of
               Finance. Similarly, due to the research interests of the teachers in film studies and
               media, many humanities students have engaged in project work related to
               cinema.

               Since the Ramanujan College works under the aegis of the University of Delhi, it
               does not have any such provision of budget being earmarked and therefore relies
               on the University and the UGC funding for research based activities. In the
               General Development Assistance Scheme, during the XIIth Plan Period, 11.4%
               of total grant sanctioned by the UGC is for Educational Innovation purposes.
               Another 9% is sanctioned for Field Work and Study Tours. The College has also
               received financial grants from the University of Delhi for research-based
               Innovation Projects that were sanctioned to it. We also seek and receive
               sponsorships from banks and other institutions for our research-based activities.

               Innovative projects involves students' research are funded by the University of
               Delhi. Some student research projects are funded directly by the College via
               UGC funds (The details are given in 3.2.1)                         
                                                                                  
               In the year 2012, the University of Delhi started a scheme to support inter-
               disciplinary Innovation Projects for the students. Three projects of the College
               got a total grant of Rs.10 lakhs. This grant had a provision not only for equipment
               purchase, travel, printing expenses, but also for a stipend of Rs. 1,000 per month
               to each student working on the projects.                           
                                                                                  
               Mr. Rohan Rawat, a first year student of Psychology (Hons.), was awarded the
               half major scholarship from the International Committee for Adlerian Summer
               School and Institutes, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK. The College
               supported Rohan by funding him the other half of the scholarship money.

               The College, on a regular basis, engages the Departments in inter-disciplinary
               dialogues. The motive is not only to bring the Departments together but also to
               focus on providing a comfortable academic environment to the students with
               humble academic background. This section of students learn through listening to
               debates, discussions and various other interactive sessions claiming themselves
               to be the prospective research force.

                    Honours, Philosophy Honours and History Honours with the intention of
                    providing an inter-disciplinary faculty that would act as an intellectual
                    resource bank for giving impetus to the research activity.

                    clock W-Fi connectivity with the intension of helping the faculty to
                    engage in academic pursuits without any hindrance. In future, when the
                    College will be able to construct its own building, the faculty will have
                    greater infrastructural support for research.

               In 2009, ASSOCHM partly funded a seminar on 'Higher Education' in which
               many well-researched academic papers on various aspects of Higher Education
               were presented.                                                    
                                                                                  
               With the introduction of new courses in the near future, the College looks
               forward to more inter-disciplinary projects and would be approaching the

               Generally, a representative of the publishers/suppliers contacts the teachers with
               the new titles and gets their recommendation for purchase of a particular
               publication. The Librarian after inquiring the titles in the holdings of the library
               orders for the purchase of the recommended publication. Sometimes, faculties

               The College is not directly involved in consultancy, but it encourages the faculty
               to provide their expertise in consultancy to outside agencies. The College keeps
               record of the individual teachers engaged in such activities. These records are
               placed at the time of teachers' promotion and other career advancement
               opportunities. As an undergraduate College pursuing mainly Commerce and
               Humanities courses, the Ramanujan College is not engaged in any income-

                    holistic development of the students.                         
                                                                                  
               In the year 2010, the Centre for Ethics and Values was set up precisely with the
               intension of promoting good citizenship, service orientation and holistic
               development of the students. The Centre organizes many inter-disciplinary
               programs that help in the objective of promoting the idea of morality and ethics
                                                                                  
               in public life, which is essential for good citizenship. To promote and instill the
               idea of social responsibility among the students, the College engages in a large
               number of activities through its different societies, NSS and NCC. This infuses
               solidarity among the students to work for each other in groups and also
               understand the value of individual responsibilities. Ramanujan College has
               developed and maintained cordial relationships with the nearby Colleges and
               Universities. Lady Sri Ram College, Acharya Narendra Dev College and
               Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, all constituent colleges of the University of
               Delhi are neighboring colleges. The University of Jamia Millia Islamia is also in
               the neighborhood. These institutions come together during the events like
               cultural festival, workshops, seminars and other interactive sessions.
                                                                                  
               3.6.2 Institutional mechanism to track students' involvement in various social
                    movements/activities which promotes the role of citizenship.  
                                                                                  
               The College has institutionalized ways to encourage students' involvement in
               social movements/activities by constituting the following societies/centres/
               committees promoting social and citizenship roles:                 
                                                                                  
                  1. The Centre for Ethics and Values plays a crucial role in generating moral
                    awareness amongst students. The Centre has been working on two
                    innovation projects namely, 'Comparison of Methodology of the 
                    Mumbai Dabbawalas and Courier Company' and 'Awareness of      
                    Consumer Rights in Contemporary India – A Comparative Study of

               3.6.3 Stakeholder's perception on the overall performance and quality of the
                    institution.                                                  
                                                                                  
               The Ramanujan College, while functioning as Deshbandhu College (Evening),
               had the objective of catering to the demands of already employed students
               desiring higher education. It earned the reputation of a good institution. Today,
                                                                                  
               as Ramanujan College, the perception about the College by its stake holders and
               others in the society has changed into a fast-growing aspiring institution.
               Feedback from teachers, both present and retired, students, parents and the
               alumni, suggests that the college is being rated high in the quality of its
               deliverance of its objectives. There is an overall perception that the College will
               soon emerge as a top rated college of the University of Delhi once it is able to
               construct its own building and infrastructure. The fact that the College was
               awarded prizes in the University of Delhi festival, Antardhvani, for the past two
               years, has also helped in raising the perception of the College as a quality
               institution.                                                       
                                                                                  
               3.6.4-5 Institutional plan and organization of its extension and outreach
                    programmes and the participation of students and faculty in extension
                    activities.                                                   
                                                                                  
               In the past five years, the College has constituted a number societies and centres.
               Though the participation in extension activities is voluntary, there is great
               enthusiasm among the students and faculty to make the activities of the societies
               very successful. Often the initiative and the idea comes from the students
               themselves and the faculty then takes the necessary steps to concretize the
               programme. Most of the cultural societies are nurtured by the Staff Council and

               The activities of the Societies range from organising festivals, competitions,
               debates, movie screenings, interactive lectures and workshops with experts and
               eminent speakers, to name a few.

               The College has undertaken various steps to ensure that it contributes to the

               names of the students and recommend the same to the College authorities for fee
               concession. After scrutinizing, the eligible students are provided with financial
               assistance. Besides this, the College also provides remedial classes and has a
               scheme of book lending.

               Till 2008, the College had been functioning as an evening college. Most of the
               facilities/infrastructure was shared with the Deshbandhu College, except the
               administrative block which was separate for our College from the beginning.
                                                                                  
               The library, the classrooms and the laboratories were common for both the
               Colleges. After 2008, the College's Governing Body thought of creating a
               separate entity and named it Ramanujan College. It started developing its
               infrastructural facilities for promoting the academic growth of its students.
                                                                                  
               The College started by separating its library from that of the Deshbandhu
               College's. We created our own library with state-of-the-art air conditioned
               reading room, and adding more books and journals in the library. We have also
               renovated the space which was allocated to us for the library.

               We further renovated the hall-cum-auditorium, which was abandoned by the
               Deshbandhu College. Later, the Governing Body approved the installing of air
               conditioners in the Auditorium. Two porta-cabins (in the Old Block) were also
               constructed for our exclusive use as classrooms in the year 2010. We also got two
                                                                                  
               rooms which are now used for the Centre for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
               and NAAC room. After 2010, we developed state-of-the-art Computer labs, in
               addition to a room for the Centre for Ethics and Values.           
                                                                                  
               In 2010, we were further allocated seven acres of land and we started the process
               of getting approvals from the relevant agencies. We also renovated our
               Administrative Block, three staff rooms, and created a separate reading room for
               teachers in the Library. We have added six washrooms both for boys and girls and
               also renovated all the old ones. Adequate arrangements for water availability
               have been made and special attention has been paid to drinking water facilities.
               Arrangements for rain water harvesting have also been made along with the
               setting up of a Compost Plant. There is a canteen for our students and beautiful
               lawns and gardens in front of the porta-cabin block. We have also created a 400 m
               athletic track in our playground.

               activities. A Ranji Trophy player has been recruited as the Coach of our cricket
               team. We have developed practice pitch for cricket.

                    games, quiz competitions, debate and discussions, cultural activities.
               Gone are the days when co-curricular activities were defined to be the rival of
                                                                                  
               academics in educational institutions. In this globalised world, the Ramanujan
               College completely acknowledges the fact that co-curricular activities do not
               follow academics but both complement each other. Academics, in conjunction
               with creative, imaginative and skill potentials, develop a well rounded
               personality. A Cultural Committee of Staff Council takes care of all the cultural
               activities. The different societies under this committee are allotted 2 to 3 teachers
               to mentor each society. Experts are invited from outside the College for
               conducting workshops and augment knowledge. The students are encouraged
               and given incentive marks on basis of extracurricular activities and sports in the
               internal assessment. They are also encouraged to be a part of these societies. The
               College takes care of the requirements of each society by allocating funds for
               their efficient functioning. Participation and excellence certificates are given to
               the students. Attractive cash and other prizes are also given to the winners of the
                                                                                  
               various competitions.

               sexual harassment. Every year, a new committee is constituted as per the rules.
               Over the years, a few cases have come before the committee and the members
               took necessary step to resolve these issues. The Committee has regularly
               cooperated with the Apex Body at the University level. Till 2014, the College had
                                                                                  
               an ordinance in accordance with the University Ordinance XV-D for sexual
               harassment. The Ordinance was about rules and regulations regarding the
               resolution of sexual harassment complaints and constitution of the College
               Complaints Committee against Sexual Harassment. Since January 2014, this
               ordinance has been superseded by the 'Sexual Harassment of Women at
               Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013'. Under the new act,
               a new committee known as Internal Complaints Committee has been constituted
               by the Principal. As per the rules, the following members are nominated by him:

               5.1.12 The Anti-Ragging Committee.                                 
                                                                                  
               There is an Anti-Ragging Committee. The Committee is constituted every year
               which takes various precautionary measures to prevent ragging on the College
               campus. It ensures the implementation of all the regulations of the UGC about
               curbing the menace of ragging in higher educational institution as per the
               directives of the Supreme Court of India. The names of all the committee
               members along with their telephone numbers and emails are displayed at
               noticeable places in the College and on the College website. The compliant boxes
               are placed in the College at the visible and strategic place. CCTV cameras
                                                                                  
               installed in the College at various points, the constant vigil of male and female
               security guards and members of teaching/non-teaching staff, with due
               instructions from the principal, taking rounds in the various locations of the
               College, has turned the College into a complete anti-ragging zone. 
                                                                                  
               An average of two/three complaints are reported every year. Some of these cases
               turn out to be fake. Most of them are sorted out by discussions and counseling.
               The others are solved by formal written apologies by the guilty, but few even lead
               to the suspension.

                 1. Mr. M.C. Sharma (Retired as Controller of Examination, CBSE)  
                 2. Mr. Amit Gupta (CA and national record holder)

                 5. Mr. K.R. Kaushik (Guest faculty, University of Delhi, and the Vice
                    President of Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited) 
                 6. Mr. Anuj Kushwaha (Ad-Hoc faculty, University of Delhi)       
                 7. Ms. Anshika Aggarwal (Ad-Hoc faculty, University of Delhi)    
                                                                                  
               Generally, the Association honors these alumni by inviting them as the Chief
               Guest on the alumni annual meet. A scholarship of Rs. 2,500/- to 25 to the
               meritorious, but needy students has been started from the year 2014-15. It has
               been decided by the Alumni Association to award this money every year.

               5.2.1 Percentage of students progressing to higher education or employment.
                                                                                  
               The College does not maintain record of the students progressing towards higher
               education. Nevertheless, we believe that many students go for some form of
               higher education. From a data base of about 200 alumni students, we have
               computed that about 60% of the students have progressed from UG to PG and
               approximately another 10% have moved beyond PG education. Approximately
               30% of the students had the benefit of campus placement. Another 30% were self-
               employed.

               Since the College has been renamed Ramanujan College from Deshbandhu
               College (Evening) in 2010 and became a full-fledged morning College, the
               vision-mission and the policy statement has undergone a major change. The

               globalizing world by offering more course and programs which have  
                                                                                  
               contemporary value. At the same time, the College also gives a serious thought to
               the socio-cultural dimension of the students and wishes to provide a holistic
               educational platform to them. It attempts to provide the teaching faculty with the
               best opportunities for self-development. Such a vision and mission could be
               transformed into reality with two prompt approaches in the policies that the
               College follows. Firstly, huge investments, both in terms of finance and planning,
               are being done for the improvement of the infrastructure. Secondly, a focused
               analysis of the curriculum is helping to create inter-disciplinary, creative and
               innovative approaches to pedagogy. The College keeps in mind its chief
               stakeholders: the students, the teaching faculty, the University, the parents, the
               public and private sector outside the Institution, and society at large, in its
               endeavor to create an educational institute of high academic standards and

               The College administration believes that the proper functioning of an institution
               can be attained through well-executed and administered hierarchy. The College,
               at the levels of teaching, non-teaching (both permanent and contractual) and
               students has instituted an efficient management system.

                   important issues like infrastructure and finance in the presence of the
                   Principal and two teacher representatives.                     
                                                                                  
                 Ÿ At the level of teaching faculty, the Staff Council plays a very significant
                   role. It acts as a mediator and catalyst between the Management and the
                   students to execute various plans decided and assigned to the various Staff
                   Council committees.                                            
                                                                                  
                 Ÿ The Principal encourages the Staff Council members to take up the
                   convener-ship of various committees and also be the in-charge of various
                   functions.

                 Ÿ The Principal encourages the students, through the Students' Union of the
                   College which, in turn, supports the College, in its efficient functioning by

               The University of Delhi ordinances regarding the governance of the College
               guide the democratic methods of transacting the day-to-day institutional affairs.
               At the core of this decentralized process, is the statutory Staff Council in which
               the entire teaching faculty, are the members. The constitution of various
               committees and the delegation of authority and responsibilities to the members
               and Conveners of the various committees ensure a decentralized method of
               functioning. The committees are constituted by a democratic process of election.
               The Staff Council has a Secretary who coordinates the activities of the
               Committees. The Committees are responsible to plan out the annual program and
               propose the budget accordingly. This method of College functioning, ensures a
                                                                                  
               holistic participation of all its members and also allows for multiple and varied
               ideas which enrich the growth of the College.                      
               6.1.7 Promoting the culture of participative management.           
                                                                                  
               The College, as a constituent College of the University of Delhi, follows the
               statues of the University and ensures the efficient implementation of the rules and
               regulations of the University of Delhi. The statutes allow for a participative

                 Ÿ The Bursar's post is rotational and appointments are made by the
                   Governing Body on the recommendation of the Principal.

               primary responsibility of the University of Delhi constituted Governing Body of
               the College is to ensure that the University stated policy of quality is maintained
               in the governance of the College.                                  
                                                                                  
               Many of the academic quality policies are framed by the Staff Council. The
               academic quality policy of the College is implemented through various
               committees of the Staff Council which are monitored by the Principal.
                                                                                  
               Since the inception of the IQAC, the quality policies are not only being framed by
               the IQAC but also the implementations are monitored by the same body.
                                                                                  
               6.2.2 The perspective plan for development.                        
                                                                                  
               The College infrastructure and academic expansion has been planned and
               approved. The essential sanctions have been obtained for the same. The
               perspective is to provide the best of the infrastructure for an academic expansion
               towards higher inter-disciplinary research.                        
                                                                                  
               With the new building and other infrastructure in place the College will provide
               students, a learning environment that will be conducive to creative and innovative
               approaches to academics. The College seeks to attract talent and the best of minds
               from across the Country and a large hostel for both girls and boys is an important
               part of our plans. The hostel will facilitate students seeking admission from remote
               parts of the Country, particularly from the states of North East. The College will
                                                                                  
               also have a larger number of women students to benefit from this expansion.
               This perspective also includes a greater interaction with the industries and other
               beneficiary agencies. The College wishes to tie up with the industry and research
                                                                                  
               agencies to work on common projects.                               
               We have already started new courses in science and humanities and have sought
               approval for some more new courses with the view of greater interaction with the
                                                                                  
               industry and the demands of the changing socio-economic scenario. The College
               seeks to develop itself into a hub of inter-disciplinary studies where research and
               skill development will form the fundamental structure. We have applied to the
               UGC for eight proposed programmes under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Centres
               for Knowledge Acquisition and Upgradation of Skilled Human Abilities and
               Livelihood (KAUSHAL) scheme.                                       
                                                                                  
               The future vision also includes the development of skills of our non-teaching
               staff, through training and skill enhancement programmes, for their personal and
               professional growth.

               Other than the Governing Body of the College, the decisions regarding the
               governance of the College are taken at the level of the Staff Council and its
               constituent committees. Decisions are also taken by the Committees that are
               constituted by the Principal directly. The implementations of the decisions are
               done in coordination with the Principal, the Staff Council Committees and the
               non-teaching staff. The activities of the Committees are reported at the Staff
               Council meetings and assessments are made.

               6.3.1-2 Enhancing the professional development of teaching and non-teaching
                    staff.                                                        
                                                                                  
               The College believes in providing a hassle-free environment to both the teaching
               and non-teaching staff by encouraging them to attend seminars and workshops,
               and their respective orientation and refresher course programs organized by the
               University as well as the College. It has recently acquired the ISO 9001:2008 for
               Office Procedure, which makes the office an error-free and qualitatively-
               enhanced work place, keeping in mind the interests of all the stakeholders. The
               College has organized many Faculty Development Programmes (FDP),   
               involving experts and eminent academicians to empower teachers with the latest
               developments in their fields. The non-teaching Staff, including the Librarian, are
               sent to various trainings, seminars and workshops.                 
                                                                                  
               6.3.3 The performance appraisal system of the staff to evaluate and ensure that
                    information about multiple activities is appropriately captured and
                    considered for better appraisal.                              
                                                                                  
               The College follows the University manual for the performance appraisal of the
               staff. The College boosts the staff to regularly enhance their experience
               qualitatively and then to submit the progress report to the College and upgrade
               their profiles. Their progress is then assessed for appraisal after they have filled
               the appraisal form of Delhi University. The appraisal system follows the API
               system of scoring points. This allows for the assessment of a wide range of
                                                                                  
               activities that the teachers pursue from academics, administrative 
               responsibilities. This appraisal system also factors in the individual teacher's
               interests and abilities in fields other than academics.            
                                                                                  
               6.3.4 The review of the performance appraisal reports by the Management.
               Through letters, the College communicates the reports to the Governing Body.
               The Management, after reviewing the reports, decides on promotions and other
                                                                                  
               sanctions (for example, leave and travel abroad) and communicates the same
               through memorandums and letters. If any discrepancy or short comings are found
               in the profile of the staff, a warning letter or memo is issued.

               The internal audit is done by the University of Delhi and the external audit by
               CAG. The audit has been completed till 2013-14. Most of the money received for
               various activities of the College is spent by the Committees constituted by the
               Staff Council or directly by the Principal. There is a collective responsibility in
               budgeting and incurring budgeted expenditure. For expenditure related to the
               infrastructure (like building and other major projects) the Governing Body takes
               decisions in meetings where the teacher representatives also take part. The
               College has constituted the Development Fund and Infrastructure Committee,

               The College has sought additional financial grants through the XI plan and XII
               plan sanctions. The financing of many of the projects, both academic and
               extracurricular, like the Innovation Projects and the Gyanodaya project, are
               financed by the University of Delhi. We have recently approached the UGC for
               obtaining additional funds for sports activities. We have also approached some
               private agencies, like publishers and banks, for financial support for programs,
               like seminars and workshops.                                       
               6.5  Internal Quality Assurance System (IQAS)                      
               6.5.1-7 Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC)                     
               The College constituted an Academic Environment Improvement Committee in
               2011. This Committee made an assessment of the academic quality of the College
               and gave suggestions regarding the need for improving the overall performance
               of the students during exams and increasing the pass percentage.   
               This Academic Environment Improvement Committee was later changed to the
               Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC).

               Some of the decisions taken by the IQAC of the College are as follows:
                                                                                  
                 1. Introduction of new undergraduate degree courses offered by the
                    University of Delhi.                                          
                 2. Introduction of diploma and certificate courses on Personality and
                    English Enhancement Course, French language and Human Rights. 
                                                                                  
                 3. The IQAC designed and introduced the feedback forms for both the
                    students and teachers.                                        
                                                                                  
                 4. Suggestions regarding the designing of the time-tables in compliance
                    with the compulsory '5 hour presence in the College' rule for the teachers.
                 5. The Students' Union leaders and class representatives have regular
                    meetings with the head of the institution. Suggestions are taken and ways
                    of implementation are discussed and decided on, in the IQAC.  
                                                                                  
                 6. The College also consults, formally and informally, experts and
                    educational leaders for guidance as part of its IQAC initiative.
                                                                                  
                 7. During the annual alumni meeting, informal discussions are held
                    regarding the ways of improving and developing the College.

               7.1-2 Eco friendly campus.                                         
                                                                                  
               The College is conscious of the environmental and ecological challenges that a
               modern and fast growing city like Delhi faces. As an institution, we try our best to
               be environmentally conscious. From installation of LED lights, to the policy of
               switching of lights, fans and air-conditioners when not in use, the College makes
               every effort to be eco-friendly. We are working towards rain water harvesting
               plan and have consulted a leading architect's consortium to execute this project.
               The College has filed a tender for the same and work will begin soon.
                                                                                  
               Environment audit of the existing building has not been done but the approved
               new building plans are based on the concept of green building and the design
               incorporates all the concepts concerning the protection and nurturing of the
                                                                                  
               environment and ecology.                                           
               The College does not produce hazardous waste, but does take special care of its e-
               waste. The College, in collaboration, with Green e-waste Recyclers Pvt. Ltd., has
                                                                                  
               handling its e-waste in an environmentally sound manner. Approximately, 110
               kgs of e-waste that was generated was handled, stored and sent to the authorized
               collection center/registered dismantler, where it was safely disposed of and
               recycled. The College also organized an 'e-waste recycling campaign' in
               collaboration with GIZ Pvt. Ltd. and the Green e-waste recyclers Pvt. Ltd.
                                                                                  
               The College has supported the environmental initiative of the Hindustan Times
               'Read, Recycle, Renew'. Our College has contributed to this project in order to
               achieve the objective of minimizing wastage.                       
                                                                                  
               7.2  Innovations                                                   
                                                                                  
               Some of the innovative ideas that the College has introduced are as follows:
                 a. Construction of porta-cabins to augment classroom and activity room
                    space to accommodate students admitted in newly introduced courses in
                    the absence of funds to construct new permanent building.     
                                                                                  
                 b. The Centre for Ethics and Values.                             
                 c. A reformed and student friendly online admission process. The College
                    has a machine for generation of Identity Cards with barcodes and library
                    cards for students during Admissions.                         
                                                                                  
                 d. IT-enabled library and computer Lab.                          
                 e. Student designed software for the College Master Time-Table.

                 1. Title of the Practice: The Construction of Porta-Cabins.      
                                                                                  
                 2. Goal: To provide within a limited time frame, additional space for
                    conducting classes and facilitating various activities, in absence of funds
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            143              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                    for the construction of the proposed new building.            
                                                                                  
                 3. The Context: Though the land has been provided for the construction of
                    a new building for the College, (within the premises of the existing
                    campus) and all plans and permissions have been obtained, the actual
                    construction of the new building has not been possible due to non-
                    availability of the funds. Since, the College was sharing the building with
                    Deshbandhu College (Morning), it was not possible for two full-time
                    colleges to function simultaneously in the same building. The College
                    found an immediate cost-effective, though temporary, solution to this
                    pressing problem, by constructing 26 porta-cabins in the land allocated to
                    the College.                                                  
                                                                                  
                 4. The Practice: 26 porta-cabins have been constructed. Built with
                    minimum cost and with fire resistant material, these cabins are durable
                    constructions, large and well ventilated. They have glazed tiles floors,
                    which are easy to clean and equipped with light but sturdy functional
                    furniture. The porta class rooms are IT-enabled. The surroundings of the
                    cabins have been landscaped beautifully with aesthetically pleasing
                    lawns, gardens and pathways. Adequate arrangements for washrooms,
                                                                                  
                    and drinking water, and staff rooms have been made. The porta-cabin area
                    has been designed with the requirements of the differently-abled in mind.
                 5. Evidence of Success: The porta-cabins have met the challenge of
                    introducing new courses and expanding the academic horizons of the
                    college, providing the students with comfortable class rooms and space
                    for activities like workshops, debates, presentations, and rehearsals for
                    music, dance and theatre productions. We are proud of the fact that non-
                                                                                  
                    availability of funds did not deter us to go ahead enthusiastically with the
                    expansion plans that involved introduction of new courses. During this
                    summer vacation, we plan to construct more porta-cabins so that our
                    dependence on shared space with Deshbandhu College is further 
                    minimized. The College plans to continue to use these porta-cabins even
                    when the new building is in place and slowly phase them out only after
                    extracting its full usage.                                    
                                                                                  
                 6. Problems Encountered and Resources Required: Though well      
                    ventilated and provided with false ceilings, the porta-cabins become
                    uncomfortably hot during the summer months. Fortunately, during the
                    summer months regular classes do not take place in the College as the
                    semester comes to an end by the third week of April and the next semester
                    beings only in the third week of July. Only examinations are conducted
                    for a few days during the summer months. Keeping in view that the
                    College is seeking the introduction of new courses in the next academic
                    year, plans are ready for the construction of 10 more porta-cabins.
                                                                                  
               Best Practice : Two                                                
                                                                                  
                 1. Title of the Practice: The Centre for Ethics and Values       
                 2. Goal: Our endeavor is to infuse the spirit of collectivism, creativity and
                    humanitarian spirit in our students. The Centre believes that education
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            144              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                    should foster values that are oriented towards unity and integrity of
                    people. Such values should help eliminate obscurantism, religious
                    fanaticism, violence and superstition. Apart from this reformative role,
                    ethics and value-education has a profound positive impact on the overall
                                                                                  
                    environment of the College. Anchored in our rich cultural heritage,
                    humanistic national goals and universal perception of peace and
                    solidarity have become the guiding path of the college.       
                 3. The Context: In the year 2010, the UGC-supported Centre for Ethics and
                    Values was initiated in the College. A one of its kind initiative, the Ethics
                    Centre, as it is popularly known, seeks to synthesize ethical and moral
                    value systems with academic pursuit, to ensure all-round growth and
                                                                                  
                    development of the students irrespective of the socio-economic and
                    cultural backgrounds that they belong to.                     
                 4. The Practice: Since 2010, the Centre has organized a national seminar,
                    two international conferences, and a national level workshop on Ethics.
                                                                                  
                    The first was a two-day seminar on 'Ethical dimensions of Governance' at
                    India International Centre in 2010. This was followed by a three-day
                    conference on 'Restoring Culture of Ethics and Values: The Holistic
                    Education Way' at the University of Delhi Conference Centre in 2012. In
                    2013, the Centre organised a students-teachers workshop on 'Power of
                    Ethics in Learning', in collaboration with Institute of Life Long
                    Learning (ILLL), University of Delhi in 2013. In 2014, a two-day
                    international conference on 'Corporate Transformation: The Ethical Way'
                    was held at YMCA, New Delhi. Each of these events added fresh impetus
                    to our efforts in making the subject of ethics and values popular.
                                                                                  
                    Other than organizing these seminars which brought recognition and
                    acclaim to the College, the Ethics Centre also organized in 2013 an
                    unique event called 'Antargyaan' or 'Inner Knowledge', in collaboration
                    with the Baha'i House of Worship (Lotus Temple), Gandhi Smriti and
                    Darshan Samiti, Rajghat. The Antargyaan festival provided a window of
                    opportunity to more than 500 students and 50 teachers to learn more about
                    Indian art and culture, cuisine, language, music, economic, politics,
                                                                                  
                    geography, history and science with a focus on the integrated and
                    synergetic culture of our country. The four-day celebrations were packed
                    with activities that included debate, drama-competition, workshops,
                    music, dance, theatre, yoga and meditation sessions.          
                    In collaboration with the NSS unit of the College, the Ethics Centre
                    organized a 'Joy of giving week', Daan Utsav from 8-15 October 2014.
                    The main purpose of this celebration was to experience joy from the core
                                                                                  
                    of heart by way of 'giving' on all the seven days of 'Daan Utsav'. Three
                    aspects of giving, that is Gyan Daan, in which students taught children
                    from the neighboring areas; Pushtika Daan, in which students donated
                    books and note books to needy children; and Mudra daan, where money
                    and articles were collected for distribution among poor was a unique way
                    to instill a conscientious heart and mind for the participants.
                    On 25 March 2015, Dr. Vinit Haksar (Fellow, Edinburgh University,
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            145              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                    U.K.) spoke on 'Happiness and Well Being'. The first ever Ethics Fest,
                    'Virasat' began on 15 April 2015, with the key note address delivered by
                    the Chief Guest, Prof. H.S. Prasad (Head, Department of Philosophy,
                    University of Delhi). A special talk was delivered by Philippines-born
                                                                                  
                    and Canada-based B. A. Janardan Swami on 'Ethics, Spirituality and
                    Personal identity'. This was followed by an interactive session exploring
                    fundamental questions such as, 'What makes me the person I am? Why
                    should we be ethical? What makes us unethical?' A special talk was also
                    given by Dr. Smita Jha (Associate Professor, IIT, Roorkee), on 'Role of
                    Ethics in meeting life-goals'. The post-lunch session included events like
                    short-film and documentary screenings and the presentation of a play on
                    ethical values made by the students of the Centre. The culminating event
                    was the Mock Parliament on Ethics. The students overwhelmingly
                    participated in the parliamentary debate to pass a legislation on Ethics.
                                                                                  
                    The Centre has published three volumes of the International Journal of
                    Applied Ethics. The Centre has also published a book entitled Ethics in
                    Governance (2011).                                            
                 5. Evidence of Success: During 2013-14, the researchers from     
                                                                                  
                    Transparency International India engaged in a study of ethical values and
                    peace study, collaborated with the Centre to study the impact of ethics on
                    the minds the students of our College. A study conducted in two parts on
                    our 700 students by Ms. Naghma Siddiqui, a research scholar of Jamia
                    Hamdard, revealed a marked positive impact that the Centre for Ethics
                    and Values made over the attitude and conduct of our students. The highly
                    positive findings of the report were published in the International
                    Journal of Applied Ethics. Both the parts of this report, Part-1 and Part-2
                    have been published in the successive issues of the Journal.  
                                                                                  
                 6. Problems Encountered and Resources Required: The Centre for   
                    Ethics and Values is a unique initiative. It has greatly helped in integrating
                    different disciplines and bringing together socially and culturally diverse
                    sections of student community in a harmonious, integrated and creative
                    platform of self-expression. The Centre has been a timely intervention in
                    making everyone aware of an ethical and moral sensibility as an essential
                    requirement for nation building. The challenge is to keep the momentum
                    on and continuously engage the students in a introspective dialogue that
                    finds its expression in concrete social interventions.        
                                                                                  
               Best Practice : Three                                              
                                                                                  
                 1. Title of the Practice: The Reformed Admission Process in Ramanujan
                    College                                                       
                                                                                  
                 2. Goal: It is our endeavor to make the experience of the students who seeks
                    admission in our College be something that they would cherish and feel
                    proud of once they get admitted.                              
                 3. The Context: Getting an admission to any college of the University of
                    Delhi in a course of one's choice is a challenging task. There is a huge
                    demand, but the seats are limited. Every year witnesses higher cut-off
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            146              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                    percentages. The students and their guardians go about the admission
                    process in the scorching summer heat of the capital with extreme anxiety,
                    tension and sometimes even harassment before they finally get a seat in
                    the University of Delhi. Keeping this in mind, our College has
                                                                                  
                    introduced, in the last three years, a highly reformed and efficient
                    admission process with the single aim of making the admissions
                    completely hassle free and smooth. We believe that the process in which
                    we conduct our admissions is a Best Practice and we are proud to be able
                    to complete our admission process without any disruptions and 
                    grievances.                                                   
                 4. The Practice: The following measures have been adopted by the College
                                                                                  
                    for its admission process:                                    
                      I. The College has an integrated admission process.         
                                                                                  
                      II. The Staff Council constituted Admission Committee decides on
                         all the parameters of admission, including fixing of cut-off
                         percentage according to the guidelines of the University of Delhi.
                         Where there is provision for the College to make its own rules, the
                         Admission Committee judiciously and collectively takes those
                         decisions. For example, the College provides 5% concessions to
                         women applicants. This is as per the College's policy to promote
                         education among women. The Admission Committee also sets up
                                                                                  
                         a help-desk, prior to the first date of admission to counsel
                         admission-seekers about the salient features of the College and
                         the admission process. The College holds Open Days for parents
                         and students in which the teachers provide counseling and
                         guidance to any parent or student who is seeking admission in our
                         College.                                                 
                      III. The actual admission process begins with the applicant getting his
                                                                                  
                         final year school mark sheet checked by the help-desk outside the
                         admission building. Only students who qualify in the cut-off
                         percentage are allowed to enter the building. Accompanying
                         parents and guardians are also allowed entry. This way we
                         minimize the number of people entering the building and thus
                         keep control of crowds.                                  
                      IV. Next, the student's registration number of the University
                                                                                  
                         admission form and the authenticity of the school documents are
                         verified. The OBC, SC, ST and PWD certificates are also  
                         checked. Marks are once again scrutinized and cut-off percentage
                         verification is done. The original documents of the applicant are
                         also checked. There are two computer stations to do this job. Each
                         unit has a set of teachers and office staff to help the applicant and,
                         hence, the step is carried on efficiently and quickly.   
                                                                                  
                      V. Post verification the applicant enters an air conditioned central
                         hall and fills up an online application form with assistance of the
                         volunteers. The student also fills up undertakings and other

               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            147              
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                         teacher in-charge of each department in the same room. A print
                         out of the filled in application form is brought to the teacher in-
                         charge for final signature. Once the application form is signed by
                         the teacher in-charge and then counter signed by the Admission
                                                                                  
                         Committee Convener, the form is sent to the bank counter which
                         is placed within this central hall. There are two bank counters and
                         the applicant then pays the admission fees there and then. The
                         bank counter stays open till all the admissions done for the day
                         have been issued receipts against payment of fees. The faculty on
                         duty also stays back till all admissions for the day have been
                         completed.                                               
                                                                                  
                      VI. We believe that the student seeking admission should be self
                         reliant and we do not encourage parents/guardians filling up
                         forms. There are adequately provided waiting halls for the
                         parents/guardians accompanying the applicants. Arrangements
                         for drinking water and washrooms for all the visitors are
                         provided. There is a separate staff room and pantry for the faculty
                         and the staff on duty.                                   
                                                                                  
                      VII. Once the admission fee is paid, the applicant is issued a bar-
                          coded student Identity-Card and library cards. For this, a
                          machine SMART50 is used by the College. Because of the  
                          machine, a common database for all the students is created and
                          is used for all the official purposes for the whole length of time
                          that the students stays in the College.                 
                      VIII.With the help of the multiple checks, we have been able to
                                                                                  
                          minimize disputes and grievances and thus reduce the    
                          admission process time which is no more than an hour and half.
                          The College keeps its admission window open till all seats in all
                          the courses are filled. Though majority admissions are done
                          within the first six days of admission (Second List), the process
                          sometimes lasts for more than 12 days (Fourth List) for some
                          courses.                                                
                                                                                  
                      IX. The College had counseling sessions both for the students and
                          the parents. The teachers take up the queries of the parents and
                          interact with them. The NSS volunteers provide services to the
                          admission seekers and make sure that they do not face any
                          problems and make the process hassle free. The College also
                          constitutes an Admission Committee, Grievance Redressed 
                          Committee, and Anti-Ragging and Disciplinary Committee. All
                          disputes or problems are addressed immediately and decisions
                          are taken promptly.                                     
                                                                                  
                      X.  The cooperative and helpful ambiance during admission process
                          helps the admission seekers who are otherwise eager and tense.
                          As a College we feel proud that we put in a collective effort
                          during the admission process.                           
                      XI. The admission process culminates with a formal orientation

                          who are admitted are welcomed to the College collectively and

                 The Department of History uses teaching methods like lectures, seminars,
                 discussions and detailed evaluation of written works. The lectures are
                 extensive, yet the emphasis is on explaining the concepts and processes as
                 lucidly as possible in order to imbibe the students with research interest. The
                 Department encourages the students to think critically and define categories
                 both heuristically and historically. The Department aims for the regular and
                 careful evaluation of students' written work as it is extremely important for
                 forming the crucial component of the learning process. The Department also
                                                                                  
                 attempts to inter-relate or even synthesize various historiographical positions
                 rather than merely focusing on their contestations and mutual contradictions.

                  The Political Science Department has been attempting to bring in a strategy
                  that can go beyond the regular method of class room teaching, within the
                  parameters of the University, for a particular curriculum of a subject. The
                  syllabus and the teaching modules are more or less fixed in nature. The
                  Department, while keeping the above lakshman rekha in mind, sets the
                                                                                  
                  following pedagogic methodologies and innovative teaching practices:-
                  1. Since we have both English and Hindi medium students, therefore, the
                     most important concern of the department is to deliver the lectures in
                     both the mediums. Mostly the books and articles are in English language
                     so all teacher make their individual notes to deliver lectures on various
                     topics in Hindi.                                             
                                                                                  
                  2. The Department has been equipping the library with the updated reading
                     list and latest published books to expose the students to the most recent
                     reading materials in the field.                              
                                                                                  
                  3. The students are continuously motivated to make use of references from
                     books, journals, websites etc. while preparing their answers and
                     projects.                                                    
                  4. Our classrooms have latest projectors, enabling the use of technology in
                     preparation of lectures and students presenting their paper through
                     power point presentation.                                    
                                                                                  
                  5. The Department conducts remedial classes for weak/average students.
                     In fact, the department also provides economic assistance to needy
                     students.                                                    
                                                                                  
                  6. The Contact Periods (CPs) are much valued in the sense that the students

                     come out with their personal doubts and queries, which otherwise
                     cannot be addressed in the class. Since it is a small group, the students
                     get an opportunity to express themselves and engage in interactive
                     discussions.                                                 
                                                                                  
                  7. To inculcate a sense of competitiveness, under Plus Politics 
                     (Departmental Society), the department organizes inter-class and inter
                     college Debate, Extempore, Quiz Competition, Poster Making, Slogan
                     writing, Cartoon Making competitions etc.                    
                                                                                  
                  8. Extensive use of Newspaper reports and articles are made in the
                     classroom teaching so as to offer the students an understanding of the
                     concept, followed by discussion among the students' vis-à-vis case
                     studies in the contemporary period.                          
                                                                                  
                  9. In order to expose the students to the expertise on various subjects, the
                     department organizes different lecturers by inviting domain experts.
                     Students are encouraged to ask question so that a healthy discussion take
                     place.                                                       
                  10. In addition to classroom teaching, study tours are arranged so that
                     students not only get an opportunity to visit and study different places
                     but also get an opportunity to build team spirit which is a vital part of a
                                                                                  
                     study tour. Towards this endeavour, the department had already
                     organized two study tours in 2014: Gandhi Bhawan [the students of
                     IMBH from Political Science (H), Statistics (H) and Hindi (H) were
                     shown around the museum and a documentary on Gandhi, followed by
                     an interactive session. The students prepared a project and PPT on the

                  11. Based on experience that when some challenges are thrown to a group of
                     students to prepare some task then it is observed that responses of the
                     students and their stimuli act more quickly and in a team spirit of
                     completing the task. This throwing up of challenge for getting work
                     done is practiced by the department. Compared to other methods, this
                     method has proved quite provocative to get the students out of their
                     shell, to act and react.

               The major challenge before the department is to understand the students and to
                                                                                  
               orient them towards the required curriculum at the same time to give them space.
               Time has come, it is not the teacher but the students who evaluates the teacher, so
               teacher has to come up with the expectation of the students to be more techno-
               savvy than the students on the other hand the course content is so vast that it is a
               big challenge to make it inter-disciplinary. A teacher expects his final product-
               students, to be more comfortable in the market where he is going to launch his
               career whatever the field may be. In the present arena teacher can force the
               students into something rather to inculcate a sense of belongingness to very
               domain the teacher wants him to enter in.

               Based on the present experience, and looking forward to expanding student-
               teacher interphase along with student-outside interphase, the following future
               plans are in hand which will be in addition to strengthening our pedagogy already
