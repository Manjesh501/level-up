=== Criterion VII: Innovations and Best Practices ===

The Ramanujan College has initiated a number of innovative practises. The focus
               has been on the environment and the society. The College showcases some of its

               most innovative ideas as best practices. In the absence of a building due to non
               availability of funds, the College has built a campus of its own by
               constructing 26 porta-cabins and creating a pleasing environment with
               pathways, gardens and lawns. This way, the College circumvented the problem
                                                                                  
               of classroom space and was able to expand by introducing new courses and
               creating space for labs, activity rooms and centres for promoting excellence.
               The College is proud to present the activities of the Centre for Ethics and
                                                                                  
               Values as one of the best practices. It is indeed a unique venture. The Centre is
               has successfully integrated ethical and moral values in the students through inter-
               disciplinary creative and imaginative activities that involve the entire college
               community.                                                         
                                                                                  
               The College regards its reformed, extremely efficient and student-friendly
               admission process as another of its best practices. The College believes that the
               students seeking admission must be given the highest priority and made to feel
               comfortable and welcome. The College has evolved a very simple but efficient
               admission process with the help of technology and the support of its staff.
                                                                                  
               The College constantly endeavours to make its campus eco-friendly. Waste
               management, rain water harvesting, tree plantation and regular cleanliness
               drives are central to the Institution's constant effort towards keeping the
               College campus clean and healthy.

               1. We have a very supportive, encouraging, motivating and cooperative Top
                  Management and Administration.                                  
                                                                                  
               2. The College has a highly qualified, dedicated and hard-working teaching
                  faculty, many of whom are also technically competent.           
                                                                                  
               3. It is our strength that we function with enthusiasm and gusto from the
                  temporary but spaciously built and information technology-enabled porta
                  cabins for classes and other activities in absence of the new building for
                  which funds are awaited.                                        
                                                                                  
               4. We have highly motivated staff who are always eager to experiment and
                  innovate, resulting in high academic performance.               
                                                                                  
               5. We face challenges with fortitude.

               1. The College needs to have a greater interaction with industry to ensure that
                                                                                  
                  the aspirations of the students find fulfilment. This is required to convert the
                  knowledge gathered in the College through curriculum into practical skills
                  that can accomplish the developmental needs of the country.     
                                                                                  
               2. The College also feels the need to establish greater contact with
                  agencies/institutions outside the College and its parent University for
                  research purposes. This is also necessary to expand the research interest of
                  the faculty and to provide them adequate resource support.      
                                                                                  
               3. For the past many years, the process of appointment of teachers has not been a
                  regular and smooth process in the University of Delhi. This has skewed the
                  ratio of permanent faculty in relation to the ad-hoc, temporary and guest
                  faculty. There is an urgent need to increase the percentage of permanent
                  faculty for a balanced overall growth of the Institution.       
                                                                                  
               OPPORTUNITIES                                                      
                                                                                  
               1. The expansion of the College that is on the cards in the near future is the
                  biggest opportunity for not only a modern-state-of-the-art infrastructural
                  facility but also for the introduction of new courses that are the need of the
                  hour.                                                           
                                                                                  
               2. It is an opportunity to put our minds and abilities together to bridge the
                  existing knowledge gaps between different sections of our society.

                  Under the University of Delhi examination system a student is given multiple
                  chances to clear his exam and get a degree even after the expiry of the term of
                  the course. In such a situation many students of the College appear for exams
                  after a gap and qualify the course. Therefore, to accurately state the
                  percentage of dropout rate is almost impossible. Nevertheless, in our
                  experience we could say that less than 10 % of the enrolled students drop out
                  and do not complete the course.
