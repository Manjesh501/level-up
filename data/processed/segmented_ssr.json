The Deshbandhu College (Evening) operated\n               from the premises of the Deshbandhu College that functioned in the morning\n               hours. Originally run by the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Education as a men's\n                                                                                  \n               College, Deshbandhu College (Evening) became a co-educational institution in\n               1994. This College, which is 100% funded by the University Grants Commission\n               (UGC) has been maintained by the University of Delhi since 1972.   \n                                                                                  \n               Till the early 90's the College catered to a large number of students who were\n               gainfully employed in the daytime and pursued their studies in the convenience\n               provided by an evening College. During its initial years the College used to\n               function in the late evening hours and developed as a reputed College especially\n               in the field of Commerce studies. Other than B. Com (Honours) and B.Com, the\n               College offered B.A. Programme and Honours courses in English, Hindi and\n               Political Science to its students. The College was also unique because it offered\n               the study of regional languages: Punjabi, Bengali and Sindhi. Late Dr. M.L.\n               Jotwani, an eminent scholar of Sindhi literature and language was a member of\n               the College teaching faculty and did the College proud when he received the\n               Padma Shri in 2003.                                                \n                                                                                  \n               In spite of being an evening College that was sharing space and infrastructure\n               with another College, Deshbandhu College (Evening) regularly produced good\n               results in academics and sports. Champion athletes, especially in the fields of\n               power lifting and weight lifting, won University, state and national level acclaim.\n                                                                                  \n               In the year 2010, the College got a new identity when the University of Delhi\n               along with UGC and the MHRD renamed Deshbandhu College (Evening) as\n               Ramanujan College, and allocated separate space of seven acres of land within\n               the existing College campus in Kalkaji, New Delhi. From an evening College it\n                                                                                  \n               become a full-fledged morning College in 2012. The College was given a go\n               ahead to design and construct an independent building and create infrastructure\n               of its own.                                                        \n                                                                                  \n               We are proud that our College is named after Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan\n               (1887-1920) the legendary Indian mathematician, who during his short lifetime\n               compiled nearly 3900 mathematical results that made him one of the world's\n               greatest-ever mathematical genius.                                 \n                                                                                  \n               Though the plans are ready and all permissions and sanctions have been acquired\n               for the construction of a new building in the land allocated to our College, the\n               College is yet to get funds to construct its own building. Nevertheless, in the past\n               four years, we have been able to immensely develop the space and resources\n               available to us. We have constructed twenty six spacious, well ventilated, ICT\n               enabled portable cabins and created additional space, infrastructure and\n               facilities for more class rooms, auditorium and laboratories. We are in the\n               process of constructing ten additional portable cabins. Additional staff rooms,\n               extra washrooms, rooms for different centres of academic excellence and a\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi              i              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               renovated library with air conditioned reading rooms have been constructed for\n               students and teachers.                                             \n                                                                                  \n               We have added generators for uninterrupted power supply and augmented our\n               water supply system and provided continuous RO filtered drinking water for our\n               students, teachers and the non-teaching staff. Many air-conditioned spaces have\n               been created in the office, staffroom, library, auditorium and activity halls for the\n               comfort of all. We have kept the needs of the physically disabled as a priority in\n                                                                                  \n               our developmental schemes.

It continues to offer B.A. Programme and B.Com\n               courses as before. It is the third largest College for Commerce education in the\n               University of Delhi. The College looks forward to a large expansion which is in\n               tune with contemporary academic and professional requirements of our country.\n               In the near future we seek to introduce Honours courses in Journalism in English,\n               History, Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) and Philosophy. We have also\n               applied to the UGC for eight proposed programmes under the Deen Dayal\n               Upadhyay Centres for Knowledge Acuisition and Upgradation of Skilled\n               Human Abilities and Livelihood (KAUSHAL) scheme. The College has a \n               highly qualified and experienced faculty some of whom are also engaged in post\n               graduate teaching at the University. A large number of our teachers have original\n               published academic and creative work in reputed national and international\n                                                                                  \n               journals. Departments of the College regularly organise seminars, workshops\n               and special lectures to benefit both students and teachers. We endeavour to make\n               our College a centre for excellence in interdisciplinary studies and research.\n                                                                                  \n               The College has a well stocked, information technology enabled and \n               computerized library, with about 30,000 books including the latest publication\n               and journals in all the subjects taught in the College. This, together with state-of-\n               the-art computer labs, offers students access to new horizons of learning.\n                                                                                  \n               A number of academic prizes and scholarships are being offered to meritorious\n               students. Financial assistance in the form of fee-concession is given to deserving\n               and needy students. Our large playground and good facilities for sports have\n               helped us to maintain a tradition of excellence in sports. Our sportspersons\n               continue to win various prizes at the University, Delhi State and national levels.\n                                                                                  \n               One of the new innovative initiatives has been the setting up of the Centre for\n               Ethics and Values in 2010. Keeping in mind the pressing need to mould a socially\n               concerned and conscientious student with moral and ethical uprightness, this\n               centre blends its activities with the regular academic and cultural programmes of\n               the College. Other than organising lectures, debates and discussions, the Centre\n               encourages introspection and positive thinking and has creatively involved the\n               students through internship, summer training, poster making, theatre, art and\n               music, in ideas related to ethics and morality. The Centre has organised two\n               international and one national level seminars and has published three volumes of\n               the International Journal of Applied Ethics. The Centre has also published a book\n                                                                                  \n               entitled Ethics in Governance (2011).                              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi              ii             \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               The College campus is a lively hub of both academic and co-curricular activities\n               which are meant to nurture the all-round development of the students. The\n               annual cultural festival of the College JOSH, which attracts students from\n               Colleges across the city, is a popular event where students showcase their talents\n                                                                                  \n               in music, dance, theatre, oration and art and craft. The College has a theatre\n               group Jazba that has been winning acclaim for their socially relevant theatre\n               presentation. Their evocative street play called Bhook dealing with the issues of\n               hunger in our country won the 'Sahitya Kala Parishad Award' for the best street\n               play in their inter-college competition in 2015. They have also produced plays\n               dealing with consumer awareness for the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. The\n               film appreciation club of the College First Cut cultivates the talents of future film\n               makers and has produced a number of well made short films. We believe the\n               students of the College are its real assets, giving it strength and character.\n                                                                                  \n               The Ramanujan College won the 'Good Practices Award' in 2014 at the annual\n               festival of the University of Delhi – Antardhvani.

In spite of the fact that the College had a reputation of being a\n               good educational institute that catered to the academic needs of the students who\n               were employed during the day time, the College was never taken as seriously as a\n               full-time morning college generally is. It was only in 2010, when Deshbandhu\n                                                                                  \n               College (Evening) was renamed as Ramanujan College and was elevated to the\n               status of a full-time morning college with the promise of a building of its own that\n               a surge of enthusiasm and renewed commitment galvanized the College towards\n               greater heights.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n               The approach to develop the College was two pronged. Firstly, the College\n               sought to provide itself with good infrastructural facilities in terms of more\n               classrooms, a multipurpose auditorium, seminar and conference halls and an\n               uninterrupted and adequate electricity and water supply. The overall ambiance of\n               the college was to be enhanced with an aesthetically pleasing environment\n               constituting lawns, gardens and pathways. The second initiative was to expand\n               the academic spectrum of the College through the introduction of new courses,\n               centers of excellence and providing the students with the opportunity of various\n               extracurricular activities.                                        \n                                                                                  \n               In the past five years, much of the developmental objectives of the College have\n               been achieved despite the fact that we have not received funds to proceed with the\n               construction of the new College building, though plans and permission have been\n               sanctioned and obtained for it.                                    \n                                                                                  \n               The College offers courses in Commerce, Humanities and Science. The College\n               has a faculty of 97 teachers (permanent, ad-hoc and part time), 53 non-teaching\n               staff and 2 technical staff, and about 2,000 students.             \n                                                                                  \n               Presented below are the brief summaries of the seven criteria of evaluation used\n               in the Self Study Report:                                          \n                                                                                  \n               Criterion I: Curricular Aspects                                    \n                                                                                  \n               Inspired by the name of the great mathematician, Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan,\n               our College adheres to the core values of dedication, hard work and commitment\n               as encapsulated in the motto of the University of Delhi. The syllabus and\n               curriculum followed by the College is set by the University of Delhi. Some of\n               the members of our Faculty are also members of curriculum framing  \n               committees of the University Departments. The College caters to almost 50%\n               of the students belonging to the economically weaker sections of the society. It is\n               a challenge to achieve the curriculum objectives, but the teachers of the College\n                                                                                  \n               have evolved innovative and effective ways of delivering curriculum content that\n               is specifically moulded for the students of our College. The College has\n               provided laptops to all its teachers and all the classrooms are ICT enabled\n               and the entire campus is Wi-Fi enabled. This has greatly felicitated the\n               implementation of the curriculum as important online data bases of research\n               journals, which the College and the University subscribes to, are available in the\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi              1              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               classroom as an aid to teaching. The faculty regularly sends feedback to the\n               University Departments regarding the curriculum with suggestions for\n               restructuring and improvement. With the dynamics of the employment \n               market in mind and with the intention of providing skill development courses, the\n                                                                                  \n               College has introduced three certificate courses: Certificate Course in Human\n               Rights, Personality and English Enhancement Course and Certificate Course in\n               French Language. There are plans to introduce four more Honours courses. Now,\n               the emphasis is on interdisciplinary and experiential pedagogy that\n               integrates issues of gender, language, environment, human rights and\n               information technology. The College organises regular seminars, special\n               lectures, educational excursions and trips along with faculty development\n               programmes and training modules for the effective implementation of the\n               curriculum. To evaluate the curriculum delivery and its effectiveness, the\n               College Internal Quality Assessment Cell (IQAC) has initiated feedback\n               systems for both students and the faculty. The College is also planning to\n               introduce an online feedback system for the students from the next academic\n               year.                                                              \n                                                                                  \n               Criterion II: Teaching, Learning and Evaluation                    \n                                                                                  \n               The Ramanujan College considers its smooth and efficient admission process as\n               one of its best practices. This ensures that the students who are admitted to the\n               College establish a warm bonding with the Institution. This bonding is reflected\n               in the cordial relations between the teacher and the student, which goes a long\n               way to ensure a healthy teaching-learning process. In accordance to the rules of\n                                                                                  \n               the University of Delhi regarding admissions, the College have seen a steady rise\n               in its cut-off percentages in the past five years, which means academically better\n               students are seeking admissions to the College every year. The College\n               encourages the women students by giving concessions on cut-off percentage\n               as a part of its admission policy. A large number of students from the\n               economically weaker section of the society are admitted to the College along\n               with students from the North Eastern states of the country. The College also\n               admits differently-abled students and provides them with all the support. The\n               College helps students with fee concessions, scholarships from the Student's Aid\n               Fund and remedial classes are organised to bridge the knowledge gaps and\n               support the marginalised students. The faculty has evolved innovative\n               approaches for teaching which includes field visits, film screening,\n               presentations and project work. The computerised library with about 30,000\n                                                                                  \n               books is a support to the teaching-learning process with about 500 users\n               accessing it every day. The time-table is prepared well in advance in the\n               beginning of an academic session so that the teaching can begin from the very\n               first day of the session. The syllabus is available on the College website. The\n               College has a system of feedback and regular assessment meetings in each\n               Department to ensure effective delivery of the syllabus and evaluate the learning\n               levels. The College recruits the best of the academic minds and encourages the\n               teachers to pursue higher academics, research and knowledge upgradation. The\n               College IAQC monitors the data regarding the performances of the students in\n               the exams and internal assessments and suggests ways of improvement in the\n               teaching-learning process. Policies regarding effective implementation of\n               time-tables, extra classes, internal assessment are set by the IAQC in\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi              2              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               consultation with the Departments. For the past few years the College, for\n               reasons beyond its control, has not been able to recruit permanent faculty and has\n               appointed ad-hoc and guest faculty. This has certainly affected the teaching-\n               learning process and we hope that with more appointments of permanent faculty,\n                                                                                  \n               the teaching-learning process will be further strengthened.        \n               CRITERION III: Research and Consultancy                            \n                                                                                  \n               As an undergraduate constituent College of the University of Delhi, research\n               possibilities in the College are limited. Nevertheless, the College promotes and\n               encourages research by its faculty and tries to inculcate research-oriented\n               academics for its students. Various FDPs, workshops and seminars are\n                                                                                  \n               organized by the College to encourage faculty research. Regular paper\n               presentations and original project work by the students is an integral part of the\n               pedagogic process in the College. The College has been sanctioned three\n               Innovation Projects, which have research components in it, by the  \n               University of Delhi. With the introduction of the Robotics and Artificial\n               Intelligence Laboratory and the Ramanujan Centre for Applied       \n               Mathematics and Research, the College is now moving into areas of  \n               advanced research. Individually, the teachers of the College have done\n               independent research in their fields and have been regularly presenting and\n               publishing their research works in books and both national and international\n               journals. The present faculty has 160 research publications and 66 books to\n               its credit. The faculty is also engaged in providing their scholarship as resource\n               to other academic institutions. To keep abreast with the latest in the field, the\n                                                                                  \n               College has been inviting imminent speakers and experts from across the country\n               for special lectures in the College. In the past two years more than 40 such\n               scholars have visited the College. As a part of inter-disciplinary approaches to\n               research, the College has been having inter-departmental workshops and\n               Faculty Development Programmes. The Centre for Ethics and Values plays\n               a crucial role in promoting extension activities of the College by engaging the\n               faculty and the students in innovative manners. It is done by liasoning the\n               Institution with the immediate neighbourhood and the society at large. The\n               Centre for Ethics and Values has published three volumes of the International\n               Journal of Applied Ethics. Five members of the faculty have also received awards\n               and recognition for their research work.                           \n                                                                                  \n               CRITERION IV: Infrastructure and Learning Resources                \n                                                                                  \n               In the last four years, the College has spent more that Rs. 5 crore on\n               augmenting its infrastructure and learning resources.

Waste\n               management, rain water harvesting, tree plantation and regular cleanliness\n               drives are central to the Institution's constant effort towards keeping the\n               College campus clean and healthy.                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi              6              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                  SWOC ANAYLYSIS                                  \n                                                                                  \n               STRENGTHS                                                          \n                                                                                  \n               1.

This is also necessary to expand the research interest of\n                  the faculty and to provide them adequate resource support.      \n                                                                                  \n               3. For the past many years, the process of appointment of teachers has not been a\n                  regular and smooth process in the University of Delhi.

Dropout rate in Under Graduate degree programs                 \n                                                                                  \n                  Under the University of Delhi examination system a student is given multiple\n                  chances to clear his exam and get a degree even after the expiry of the term of\n                  the course. In such a situation many students of the College appear for exams\n                  after a gap and qualify the course. Therefore, to accurately state the\n                  percentage of dropout rate is almost impossible. Nevertheless, in our\n                  experience we could say that less than 10 % of the enrolled students drop out\n                  and do not complete the course.                                 \n                                                                                  \n               26.

The primary objective of the curriculum set by the University\n               for the various subjects is to provide in-depth and high level learning that would\n               help the student to mature into a capable human resource who is able to find\n               opportunities and also effectively deliver the need to develop the various sectors\n                                                                                  \n               of the Nation.

Inter-disciplinary approaches as teaching\n               methods are encouraged through seminars, talks and workshops that are open for\n               all the faculty members of the College. The College Library is constantly\n               updated with latest books and that help in curriculum delivery. Often, hands-on\n               approaches along with experiential learning techniques are used for the effective\n               implementation of the curriculum.                                  \n                                                                                  \n               1.2  Academic Flexibility                                          \n               1.2.1 Certificate/diploma/skill development courses offered by the Institution.\n                                                                                  \n               The objective and goal of offering the two Certificate Courses on 'Human Rights'\n               and 'Personality and English Enhancement' is to equip students with skills to face\n               the modern challenges of a fast evolving world.

It uses the flexibility available under the\n               University-prescribed curriculum to offer students these supplementary courses\n               and the UGC supported remedial classes for enhancing career opportunities. The\n               Ethics Centre established by the College also contributes towards the curriculum\n               requirements of various disciplines.                               \n                                                                                  \n               1.2.2 Twinning/dual degree.                                        \n                                                                                  \n               The Ramanujan College being a constituent college of the University of Delhi\n               follows the prescribed curriculum for the degree pursued and as such offers no\n               twining or dual degree.

In\n               the year 2015, the College also applied to the University for the approval of the\n               following courses:                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                 1.

Since the implementation of the Semester system in the University of\n               Delhi, and the introduction of bi-annual examinations the time frame to complete\n               course is considerably tightened and thus completing course is a challenge.\n                                                                                  \n               The challenge is taken up earnestly by the College by adopting the following\n               measures:                                                          \n                                                                                  \n                 1. The Master Time-Table is prepared well before the commencement of the\n                    academic session and the Departments prepare individual and class time-\n                    tables which are uploaded on the College website before beginning of the\n                    semester. Time-tables are sent to the faculty through e-mail. This ensures\n                    that classes commence on the very first day of the semester.  \n                                                                                  \n                 2.

For the syllabus to be completed in time it is important that slow learners\n                    are given special attention. Remedial classes are organized for them.\n                                                                                  \n               2.3.11 Monitoring and evaluating the quality of teaching-learning. \n                                                                                  \n               Under the guidance of the Internal Quality Assessment Cell (IQAC) of the\n               College the monitoring and evaluation of the teaching learning process is done in\n               the following manner:                                              \n                                                                                  \n                 1.

There is an overall perception that the College will\n               soon emerge as a top rated college of the University of Delhi once it is able to\n               construct its own building and infrastructure. The fact that the College was\n               awarded prizes in the University of Delhi festival, Antardhvani, for the past two\n               years, has also helped in raising the perception of the College as a quality\n               institution.                                                       \n                                                                                  \n               3.6.4-5 Institutional plan and organization of its extension and outreach\n                    programmes and the participation of students and faculty in extension\n                    activities.                                                   \n                                                                                  \n               In the past five years, the College has constituted a number societies and centres.\n               Though the participation in extension activities is voluntary, there is great\n               enthusiasm among the students and faculty to make the activities of the societies\n               very successful. Often the initiative and the idea comes from the students\n               themselves and the faculty then takes the necessary steps to concretize the\n               programme.

It started developing its\n               infrastructural facilities for promoting the academic growth of its students.\n                                                                                  \n               The College started by separating its library from that of the Deshbandhu\n               College's. We created our own library with state-of-the-art air conditioned\n               reading room, and adding more books and journals in the library. We have also\n               renovated the space which was allocated to us for the library.     \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi             74              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               We further renovated the hall-cum-auditorium, which was abandoned by the\n               Deshbandhu College. Later, the Governing Body approved the installing of air\n               conditioners in the Auditorium. Two porta-cabins (in the Old Block) were also\n               constructed for our exclusive use as classrooms in the year 2010. We also got two\n                                                                                  \n               rooms which are now used for the Centre for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence\n               and NAAC room. After 2010, we developed state-of-the-art Computer labs, in\n               addition to a room for the Centre for Ethics and Values.           \n                                                                                  \n               In 2010, we were further allocated seven acres of land and we started the process\n               of getting approvals from the relevant agencies. We also renovated our\n               Administrative Block, three staff rooms, and created a separate reading room for\n               teachers in the Library. We have added six washrooms both for boys and girls and\n               also renovated all the old ones. Adequate arrangements for water availability\n               have been made and special attention has been paid to drinking water facilities.\n               Arrangements for rain water harvesting have also been made along with the\n               setting up of a Compost Plant. There is a canteen for our students and beautiful\n               lawns and gardens in front of the porta-cabin block. We have also created a 400 m\n               athletic track in our playground.                                  \n                                                                                  \n               We have tied up with a sports academy to train our students in various sports\n               activities. A Ranji Trophy player has been recruited as the Coach of our cricket\n               team. We have developed practice pitch for cricket.                \n                                                                                  \n               As regards to our future expansion, the master plan of our institution includes\n               Academic Block, student facility centre with provision for a canteen, bank,\n               indoor games, gym and common room for both boys and girls. There is in the\n               design, plans for a large Library, Lecture Theatre Block and a Hostel Block for\n               both boys and girls. We have been promised financial assistance by the\n               University of Delhi. Funding from the UGC and as well as the MHRD is awaited.\n                                                                                  \n               The project work for construction of the new building has already been assigned\n               to RITES. The tender documents for the Academic Block are ready and we are\n               hopeful that construction will start in the next academic year.

Approximately\n               30% of the students had the benefit of campus placement. Another 30% were self-\n               employed.                                                          \n                                                                                  \n

The Context: Though the land has been provided for the construction of\n                    a new building for the College, (within the premises of the existing\n                    campus) and all plans and permissions have been obtained, the actual\n                    construction of the new building has not been possible due to non-\n                    availability of the funds. Since, the College was sharing the building with\n                    Deshbandhu College (Morning), it was not possible for two full-time\n                    colleges to function simultaneously in the same building. The College\n                    found an immediate cost-effective, though temporary, solution to this\n                    pressing problem, by constructing 26 porta-cabins in the land allocated to\n                    the College.                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                 4. The Practice: 26 porta-cabins have been constructed. Built with\n                    minimum cost and with fire resistant material, these cabins are durable\n                    constructions, large and well ventilated. They have glazed tiles floors,\n                    which are easy to clean and equipped with light but sturdy functional\n                    furniture. The porta class rooms are IT-enabled. The surroundings of the\n                    cabins have been landscaped beautifully with aesthetically pleasing\n                    lawns, gardens and pathways. Adequate arrangements for washrooms,\n                                                                                  \n                    and drinking water, and staff rooms have been made. The porta-cabin area\n                    has been designed with the requirements of the differently-abled in mind.\n                 5. Evidence of Success: The porta-cabins have met the challenge of\n                    introducing new courses and expanding the academic horizons of the\n                    college, providing the students with comfortable class rooms and space\n                    for activities like workshops, debates, presentations, and rehearsals for\n                    music, dance and theatre productions. We are proud of the fact that non-\n                                                                                  \n                    availability of funds did not deter us to go ahead enthusiastically with the\n                    expansion plans that involved introduction of new courses. During this\n                    summer vacation, we plan to construct more porta-cabins so that our\n                    dependence on shared space with Deshbandhu College is further \n                    minimized. The College plans to continue to use these porta-cabins even\n                    when the new building is in place and slowly phase them out only after\n                    extracting its full usage.                                    \n                                                                                  \n                 6. Problems Encountered and Resources Required: Though well      \n                    ventilated and provided with false ceilings, the porta-cabins become\n                    uncomfortably hot during the summer months. Fortunately, during the\n                    summer months regular classes do not take place in the College as the\n                    semester comes to an end by the third week of April and the next semester\n                    beings only in the third week of July. Only examinations are conducted\n                    for a few days during the summer months. Keeping in view that the\n                    College is seeking the introduction of new courses in the next academic\n                    year, plans are ready for the construction of 10 more porta-cabins.\n                                                                                  \n               Best Practice : Two                                                \n                                                                                  \n                 1.

Such values should help eliminate obscurantism, religious\n                    fanaticism, violence and superstition. Apart from this reformative role,\n                    ethics and value-education has a profound positive impact on the overall\n                                                                                  \n                    environment of the College. Anchored in our rich cultural heritage,\n                    humanistic national goals and universal perception of peace and\n                    solidarity have become the guiding path of the college.       \n                 3. The Context: In the year 2010, the UGC-supported Centre for Ethics and\n                    Values was initiated in the College. A one of its kind initiative, the Ethics\n                    Centre, as it is popularly known, seeks to synthesize ethical and moral\n                    value systems with academic pursuit, to ensure all-round growth and\n                                                                                  \n                    development of the students irrespective of the socio-economic and\n                    cultural backgrounds that they belong to.                     \n                 4. The Practice: Since 2010, the Centre has organized a national seminar,\n                    two international conferences, and a national level workshop on Ethics.\n                                                                                  \n                    The first was a two-day seminar on 'Ethical dimensions of Governance' at\n                    India International Centre in 2010. This was followed by a three-day\n                    conference on 'Restoring Culture of Ethics and Values: The Holistic\n                    Education Way' at the University of Delhi Conference Centre in 2012. In\n                    2013, the Centre organised a students-teachers workshop on 'Power of\n                    Ethics in Learning', in collaboration with Institute of Life Long\n                    Learning (ILLL), University of Delhi in 2013. In 2014, a two-day\n                    international conference on 'Corporate Transformation: The Ethical Way'\n                    was held at YMCA, New Delhi. Each of these events added fresh impetus\n                    to our efforts in making the subject of ethics and values popular.\n                                                                                  \n                    Other than organizing these seminars which brought recognition and\n                    acclaim to the College, the Ethics Centre also organized in 2013 an\n                    unique event called 'Antargyaan' or 'Inner Knowledge', in collaboration\n                    with the Baha'i House of Worship (Lotus Temple), Gandhi Smriti and\n                    Darshan Samiti, Rajghat. The Antargyaan festival provided a window of\n                    opportunity to more than 500 students and 50 teachers to learn more about\n                    Indian art and culture, cuisine, language, music, economic, politics,\n                                                                                  \n                    geography, history and science with a focus on the integrated and\n                    synergetic culture of our country. The four-day celebrations were packed\n                    with activities that included debate, drama-competition, workshops,\n                    music, dance, theatre, yoga and meditation sessions.          \n                    In collaboration with the NSS unit of the College, the Ethics Centre\n                    organized a 'Joy of giving week', Daan Utsav from 8-15 October 2014.\n                    The main purpose of this celebration was to experience joy from the core\n                                                                                  \n                    of heart by way of 'giving' on all the seven days of 'Daan Utsav'. Three\n                    aspects of giving, that is Gyan Daan, in which students taught children\n                    from the neighboring areas; Pushtika Daan, in which students donated\n                    books and note books to needy children; and Mudra daan, where money\n                    and articles were collected for distribution among poor was a unique way\n                    to instill a conscientious heart and mind for the participants.\n                    On 25 March 2015, Dr. Vinit Haksar (Fellow, Edinburgh University,\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            145              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                    U.K.) spoke on 'Happiness and Well Being'.

This was followed by an interactive session exploring\n                    fundamental questions such as, 'What makes me the person I am? Why\n                    should we be ethical? What makes us unethical?' A special talk was also\n                    given by Dr. Smita Jha (Associate Professor, IIT, Roorkee), on 'Role of\n                    Ethics in meeting life-goals'. The post-lunch session included events like\n                    short-film and documentary screenings and the presentation of a play on\n                    ethical values made by the students of the Centre. The culminating event\n                    was the Mock Parliament on Ethics. The students overwhelmingly\n                    participated in the parliamentary debate to pass a legislation on Ethics.\n                                                                                  \n                    The Centre has published three volumes of the International Journal of\n                    Applied Ethics. The Centre has also published a book entitled Ethics in\n                    Governance (2011).                                            \n                 5. Evidence of Success: During 2013-14, the researchers from     \n                                                                                  \n                    Transparency International India engaged in a study of ethical values and\n                    peace study, collaborated with the Centre to study the impact of ethics on\n                    the minds the students of our College. A study conducted in two parts on\n                    our 700 students by Ms. Naghma Siddiqui, a research scholar of Jamia\n                    Hamdard, revealed a marked positive impact that the Centre for Ethics\n                    and Values made over the attitude and conduct of our students. The highly\n                    positive findings of the report were published in the International\n                    Journal of Applied Ethics. Both the parts of this report, Part-1 and Part-2\n                    have been published in the successive issues of the Journal.  \n                                                                                  \n                 6. Problems Encountered and Resources Required: The Centre for   \n                    Ethics and Values is a unique initiative. It has greatly helped in integrating\n                    different disciplines and bringing together socially and culturally diverse\n                    sections of student community in a harmonious, integrated and creative\n                    platform of self-expression. The Centre has been a timely intervention in\n                    making everyone aware of an ethical and moral sensibility as an essential\n                    requirement for nation building. The challenge is to keep the momentum\n                    on and continuously engage the students in a introspective dialogue that\n                    finds its expression in concrete social interventions.        \n                                                                                  \n               Best Practice : Three                                              \n                                                                                  \n                 1.

Goal: It is our endeavor to make the experience of the students who seeks\n                    admission in our College be something that they would cherish and feel\n                    proud of once they get admitted.                              \n                 3. The Context: Getting an admission to any college of the University of\n                    Delhi in a course of one's choice is a challenging task. There is a huge\n                    demand, but the seats are limited. Every year witnesses higher cut-off\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            146              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                    percentages. The students and their guardians go about the admission\n                    process in the scorching summer heat of the capital with extreme anxiety,\n                    tension and sometimes even harassment before they finally get a seat in\n                    the University of Delhi. Keeping this in mind, our College has\n                                                                                  \n                    introduced, in the last three years, a highly reformed and efficient\n                    admission process with the single aim of making the admissions\n                    completely hassle free and smooth. We believe that the process in which\n                    we conduct our admissions is a Best Practice and we are proud to be able\n                    to complete our admission process without any disruptions and \n                    grievances.                                                   \n                 4. The Practice: The following measures have been adopted by the College\n                                                                                  \n                    for its admission process:                                    \n                      I. The College has an integrated admission process.         \n                                                                                  \n                      II. The Staff Council constituted Admission Committee decides on\n                         all the parameters of admission, including fixing of cut-off\n                         percentage according to the guidelines of the University of Delhi.\n                         Where there is provision for the College to make its own rules, the\n                         Admission Committee judiciously and collectively takes those\n                         decisions. For example, the College provides 5% concessions to\n                         women applicants. This is as per the College's policy to promote\n                         education among women. The Admission Committee also sets up\n                                                                                  \n                         a help-desk, prior to the first date of admission to counsel\n                         admission-seekers about the salient features of the College and\n                         the admission process. The College holds Open Days for parents\n                         and students in which the teachers provide counseling and\n                         guidance to any parent or student who is seeking admission in our\n                         College.                                                 \n                      III. The actual admission process begins with the applicant getting his\n                                                                                  \n                         final year school mark sheet checked by the help-desk outside the\n                         admission building. Only students who qualify in the cut-off\n                         percentage are allowed to enter the building. Accompanying\n                         parents and guardians are also allowed entry. This way we\n                         minimize the number of people entering the building and thus\n                         keep control of crowds.                                  \n                      IV. Next, the student's registration number of the University\n                                                                                  \n                         admission form and the authenticity of the school documents are\n                         verified. The OBC, SC, ST and PWD certificates are also  \n                         checked. Marks are once again scrutinized and cut-off percentage\n                         verification is done. The original documents of the applicant are\n                         also checked. There are two computer stations to do this job. Each\n                         unit has a set of teachers and office staff to help the applicant and,\n                         hence, the step is carried on efficiently and quickly.   \n                                                                                  \n                      V. Post verification the applicant enters an air conditioned central\n                         hall and fills up an online application form with assistance of the\n                         volunteers. The student also fills up undertakings and other\n                         required documents.

A print\n                         out of the filled in application form is brought to the teacher in-\n                         charge for final signature. Once the application form is signed by\n                         the teacher in-charge and then counter signed by the Admission\n                                                                                  \n                         Committee Convener, the form is sent to the bank counter which\n                         is placed within this central hall. There are two bank counters and\n                         the applicant then pays the admission fees there and then. The\n                         bank counter stays open till all the admissions done for the day\n                         have been issued receipts against payment of fees. The faculty on\n                         duty also stays back till all admissions for the day have been\n                         completed.                                               \n                                                                                  \n                      VI. We believe that the student seeking admission should be self\n                         reliant and we do not encourage parents/guardians filling up\n                         forms. There are adequately provided waiting halls for the\n                         parents/guardians accompanying the applicants. Arrangements\n                         for drinking water and washrooms for all the visitors are\n                         provided. There is a separate staff room and pantry for the faculty\n                         and the staff on duty.                                   \n                                                                                  \n                      VII. Once the admission fee is paid, the applicant is issued a bar-\n                          coded student Identity-Card and library cards. For this, a\n                          machine SMART50 is used by the College. Because of the  \n                          machine, a common database for all the students is created and\n                          is used for all the official purposes for the whole length of time\n                          that the students stays in the College.                 \n                      VIII.With the help of the multiple checks, we have been able to\n                                                                                  \n                          minimize disputes and grievances and thus reduce the    \n                          admission process time which is no more than an hour and half.\n                          The College keeps its admission window open till all seats in all\n                          the courses are filled. Though majority admissions are done\n                          within the first six days of admission (Second List), the process\n                          sometimes lasts for more than 12 days (Fourth List) for some\n                          courses.                                                \n                                                                                  \n                      IX. The College had counseling sessions both for the students and\n                          the parents. The teachers take up the queries of the parents and\n                          interact with them. The NSS volunteers provide services to the\n                          admission seekers and make sure that they do not face any\n                          problems and make the process hassle free. The College also\n                          constitutes an Admission Committee, Grievance Redressed \n                          Committee, and Anti-Ragging and Disciplinary Committee. All\n                          disputes or problems are addressed immediately and decisions\n                          are taken promptly.                                     \n                                                                                  \n                      X.  The cooperative and helpful ambiance during admission process\n                          helps the admission seekers who are otherwise eager and tense.\n                          As a College we feel proud that we put in a collective effort\n                          during the admission process.                           \n                      XI.

The\n                  Department, while keeping the above lakshman rekha in mind, sets the\n                                                                                  \n                  following pedagogic methodologies and innovative teaching practices:-\n                  1. Since we have both English and Hindi medium students, therefore, the\n                     most important concern of the department is to deliver the lectures in\n                     both the mediums. Mostly the books and articles are in English language\n                     so all teacher make their individual notes to deliver lectures on various\n                     topics in Hindi.                                             \n                                                                                  \n                  2. The Department has been equipping the library with the updated reading\n                     list and latest published books to expose the students to the most recent\n                     reading materials in the field.                              \n                                                                                  \n                  3. The students are continuously motivated to make use of references from\n                     books, journals, websites etc. while preparing their answers and\n                     projects.                                                    \n                  4. Our classrooms have latest projectors, enabling the use of technology in\n                     preparation of lectures and students presenting their paper through\n                     power point presentation.                                    \n                                                                                  \n                  5. The Department conducts remedial classes for weak/average students.\n                     In fact, the department also provides economic assistance to needy\n                     students.                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                  6. The Contact Periods (CPs) are much valued in the sense that the students\n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n               Ramanujan College, University of Delhi            247              \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                                  \n                     come out with their personal doubts and queries, which otherwise\n                     cannot be addressed in the class. Since it is a small group, the students\n                     get an opportunity to express themselves and engage in interactive\n                     discussions.                                                 \n                                                                                  \n                  7. To inculcate a sense of competitiveness, under Plus Politics \n                     (Departmental Society), the department organizes inter-class and inter\n                     college Debate, Extempore, Quiz Competition, Poster Making, Slogan\n                     writing, Cartoon Making competitions etc.                    \n                                                                                  \n                  8. Extensive use of Newspaper reports and articles are made in the\n                     classroom teaching so as to offer the students an understanding of the\n                     concept, followed by discussion among the students' vis-à-vis case\n                     studies in the contemporary period.                          \n                                                                                  \n                  9. In order to expose the students to the expertise on various subjects, the\n                     department organizes different lecturers by inviting domain experts.\n                     Students are encouraged to ask question so that a healthy discussion take\n                     place.                                                       \n                  10. In addition to classroom teaching, study tours are arranged so that\n                     students not only get an opportunity to visit and study different places\n                     but also get an opportunity to build team spirit which is a vital part of a\n                                                                                  \n                     study tour. Towards this endeavour, the department had already\n                     organized two study tours in 2014: Gandhi Bhawan [the students of\n                     IMBH from Political Science (H), Statistics (H) and Hindi (H) were\n                     shown around the museum and a documentary on Gandhi, followed by\n                     an interactive session. The students prepared a project and PPT on the\n                     same as a part of their course curriculum] and Orissa (details mentioned\n                     above).                                                      \n                                                                                  \n                  11. Based on experience that when some challenges are thrown to a group of\n                     students to prepare some task then it is observed that responses of the\n                     students and their stimuli act more quickly and in a team spirit of\n                     completing the task. This throwing up of challenge for getting work\n                     done is practiced by the department. Compared to other methods, this\n                     method has proved quite provocative to get the students out of their\n                     shell, to act and react.                                     \n                                                                                  \n                  12.
